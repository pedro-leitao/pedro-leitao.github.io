We love to walk, eat good food, and explore.","prompt_id":"7682c850c4e5979cef0ad966b8feb119de2bd323bb40819767a161040b59eb7a","messages":[{"content":"What are 5 things I can do when it's raining in London? I am visiting for the first time and only for a week with my husband. We love to walk, eat good food, and explore.","role":"user"},{"content":"Sure! Here are five options for things to do in London on a rainy day:\n\n1. Visit The British Museum. Dedicated to human history, art and culture, The British Museum has over 8 million permanent objects in its collection and is spread over multiple floors and wings of its impressive Bloomsbury building. From its extensive collection of Egyptian mummies to the Rosetta Stone, there are numerous exhibitions to capture your imagination. The museum is free to enjoy, though runs separately ticketed exhibitions throughout the year, as well. \n\n2. Explore Spitalfields Market. Since the 17th century, traders have been operating out of this East London market selling food, art, antiques, jewellery, and so much more. Today, the covered market is a hot destination for fashion and food enthusiasts with numerous stalls and shops open every day of the week. On the weekends, the market hosts various community events including pop-up music festivals. \n\n3. Shop at Westfield London. Located in West London, Westfield London is an enormous shopping centre hosting roughly 320 stores and restaurants spread over 2.5 million square feet, including the high-end retail sector named The Village. In addition to a wide selection of food and shopping, there are multiple activity options including miniature golf, rock climbing, and a cinema. \n\n4. Visit the Barbican Centre. The Barbican Centre is a large performing arts centre in the City of London nestled in the impressive Barbican Estate, which is an impressive example of Brutalist architecture. The centre is home to both the London Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, in addition to hosting multiple theatre performances, film screenings, and additional concerts. The public are also welcome to enjoy its library, dine in one of its three restaurants, or explore its vast indoor conservatory. \n\n5. Explore the Battersea Power Station. The Grade-II listed Battersea Power Station, which sits on the south bank of the Thames just west of Westminster, was recently refurbished and reopened as a shopping and leisure destination. Inside the building, there are various shops, eateries, and bard including Control Room B: a cocktail bar nestled within the original dials and controls of the power station. If there's a break in the rainy weather, the riverfront of the power station is lined with additional food stalls, and Battersea Park is a short five-minute walk away down the bank of the Thames. If the rain stays all day, though, there are plenty of activities sheltered by the power station including miniature gold, ping pong, and a cinema. \n\nWhether it's rain or shine, London has an endless supply of activities, sights, and eateries to ensure you have an unforgettable trip.

The music genre known as pirate metal is a unique blend of heavy metal and sea shanties, accompanied by folk instruments like the concertina. Despite the unusual mix, bands such as Alestorm have found success in this genre and have a dedicated following.\n2. Math rock is an indie rock style that utilizes complex time signatures and unusual meters. The genre emerged in the 1980s and peaked in the mid-1990s. Today, similar techniques have been adapted to pop music, resulting in the creation of the genre known as \"math pop.\"\n3. Steven Roden created the minimalist ambient music genre called \"lowercase\" in 2001 by manipulating and amplifying sounds made from handling paper. The genre is characterized by its quiet and unobtrusive nature and gained attention following the release of the compilation album \"Lowercase-Sound\" in 2002. Roden's track \"Bell Is The Truth (Berlin)\" exemplifies the beauty of the genre, created by tapping light bulbs in total darkness to produce bell-like sounds.\n4. Witch House is a genre that doesn't have any resemblance to house music, despite the name. It was coined by Travis Egedy (aka, Pictureplane) and features slow tempo, chopped and screwed songs with elements of goth, shoegaze, hip-hop, drone, noise, and industrial. Other artists, such as Clams Casino, Holy Other, and Zola Jesus, have also incorporated Witch House elements into their music. Though the genre burned out after a few years, it remains captivating.\n5. Skweee is a genre of mostly instrumental music that originated in Sweden and Finland, combining synth leads and basslines with funk and soul rhythms. Its name reflects the idea of squeezing out the grooviest sound possible. Skweee was also a major influence on dubstep during 2008-2009.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Tlachihualtepetl, also called the Great Pyramid of Cholula, is 217 feet (66 meters) tall and its base is 1,476 by 1,1476 feet (450 by 450 meters). Its total volume is 157 million cubic feet. Due to its size, it took centuries to build. It was worked on several different times between 300 BC and 700 AD. There was a temple above it to worship Quetzalcoatl - the Aztec god of learning and books. However, the temple was abandoned around the 8th or 9th century AD. Over time, it became covered with vegetation. As a result, it blended in and Spaniards first mistook it for a hill when they conquered Mexico in 1521. They replaced the temple with a church and the pyramid stayed hidden until the 1930s when the earth started to erode. Archeologists have excavated and studied many parts of the pyramid since then, including the altars. It has also become a tourist attraction since then. Thousands of people visit Tlachihualtepetl each year. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

In 1976, my primary source of income came from TV appearances. You remember those, like The Hollywood Squares, Donny & Marie, The Sonny and Cher Show, and The Brady Bunch Hour? But after I left Ike, I started getting sued for all these gigs that we'd had to cancel. I had to resume touring with United Artists just to pay off my debts, but thanks to Bob Mackie I came back sexier than ever in 77! My career really took off, from cabaret shows in Vegas to tours across the US and Australia.  \n\nRough, my third solo album, came out in 1978 and was distributed across the U.S. and Europe! And then there was my next album, Love Explosion, which was my exploration into disco. Unfortunately, neither of these performed very well, so I ended up leaving United Artists. I still got to headline another tour, at least.\n\nin 1979, I ran into an Australian manager named Roger Davies. After he saw me perform in San Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, he agreed to be my manager! I was back in the international spotlight, working in Italy on Luna Park and touring in South Africa. That move of mine got a lot of flack, and to tell you the truth, I regret my naivety about the apartheid. \n\nFlash forward to October 1981, when Rod Stewart saw me perform in New York City and invited me to perform on Saturday Night Live with him. The next month, I opened for the Rolling Stones on their American Tour. Early the next year, I got to perform on the Willem Ruis show in the Netherlands, and my song \"Shame, Shame, Shame,\" ended up being a hit. My cover of \"Ball of Confusion\" (that I recorded for B.E.F.) was really popular in European dance clubs. I even got to film an MTV music video for that song. I was one of the first black American artists on the channel. I also got to appear on Chuck Berry's television special that year. The rest, as they say, is history!\n\nSincerely, \nTina Turner","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

The function 'checkForEvens' iterates through an array and if a number in the array is divisible by 2, then it gets added to 'answer' which is later returned.\n\nThe reason the function may not be returning the expected result is because of the if statement, 'if (nums[i] \/2 == 0)'. The statement is looking for numbers that get divided by 2 in the array and equal 0, which doesn't align with what you expect the function to do. \n\nInstead, you want to use the modulo operator to check for the remainder of a number that is being divided by 2.

I'm not sick, I just feel sort of blah. Make me a list of things of healthy habits I can do.","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a list of 12 healthy daily habits that you can start.\n\n1. Get up early. Getting up early is a great habit to have. People have a natural circadian rhythm that controls certain hormones. Waking up early will help you maintain your circadian rhythm.\n2. Drink water in the morning. Drinking water soon after you wake up will help keep you hydrated. Since low levels of dehydration are linked with fatigue and headaches, you should drink water when you first get up.\n3. Incorporate movement into your day. Human bodies were designed to move, yet many of your jobs are sedentary. You should incorporate movement into your day because exercise has tremendous health benefits.\n4. Go outside. Being outside will allow you to breathe some fresh air. The sunlight also provides vitamin D which your body needs. Deficiencies in vitamin D are linked to fatigue, low mood, and depression.\n5. Sit down to eat. Digestion occurs best when you are sitting down. \n6. Walking. Although walking is often overlooked as a healthy habit, it improves fitness, and heart health, and prevents gaining weight. Walking is also linked to improved posture and circulation.\n7. Cook for yourself. Cooking for yourself allows you to control what you are eating. Cooking is also a form of self-care that you can practice every day.\n8. Eat some vegetables. Eating vegetables is a healthy choice. By choosing to eat vegetables, you can reduce the number of unhealthy foods you eat.\n9. Limit your phone time. Studies have shown that the blue light emitted from phones leads to a reduction in melatonin which your body needs to regulate sleep. This can negatively affect your natural circadian rhythm.\n10. Do some cleaning. A messy physical space around you can affect your mood. Cleaning up can reduce frustration and make it easier to cook for yourself.\n11. Read something. Reading can stimulate growth, reduce stress, reduce age-related cognitive decline, and help you sleep at night.\n12. Get plenty of rest. It is recommended that you get at least 8 hours of sleep at night. Low-quality sleep and lack of sleep have been linked to several ailments. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Later she appeared in Vienna, Austria, in the play \"Springtime.\"\n\nEuropean directors appreciated Wong's unique talents and beauty, and they used her in ways that stereotype-minded Hollywood, hemmed in by American prejudice, would not or could not. Moving to Germany to appear in German films, she became acquainted with German film personalities, including Marlene Dietrich and actress-filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl. She learned German and French and began to develop a continental European attitude and outlook. In Europe she was welcomed as a star. According to her biographer Graham Russell Gao Hodges, Wong hobnobbed with \"an intellectual elite that included princes, playwrights, artists and photographers who clamored to work with her.\" Anna May Wong was featured in magazines all over the world, far more than actresses of a similar level of accomplishment. She became a media superstar, and her coiffure and complexion were copied, while \"coolie coats\" became the rage. According to Hodges, \"[S]he was the one American star who spoke to the French people, more than Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford or Mary Pickford, the top American actresses of the time.\" But, ironically, \"[S]he's the one who's now forgotten.\" Wong was cast in Ewald Andr\u00e9 Dupont's silent film Piccadilly (1929) as a maid who is fired from her job at a London nightclub after dancing on top of a table, then rehired as a dancer to infuse the club with exotic glamour. Her first talkie was The Flame of Love (1930) (aka \"The Road to Dishonour\", although some sources claim it was \"Song\" aka \"Wasted Love\" in that same year), which was released by British International Pictures. In a time before dubbing, when different versions of a single film were filmed in different languages, Wong played in the English, French and German versions of the movie.\n\nParamount Pictures offered her a contract with the promise of lead roles in major productions. Returning to the US in 1930, Wong appeared on Broadway in the play \"On the Spot.\" It was a hit, running for 167 performances, and she moved on to Hollywood and Paramount, where she starred in an adaptation of Sax Rohmer's novel \"Daughter of Fu Manchu\" called Daughter of the Dragon (1931). She was back in stereotype-land, this time as the ultimate \"Dragon Lady,\" who with her father Fu Manchu (played by ethnic Swede Warner Oland, the future Charlie Chan) embodied the evil \"Yellow Peril.\" While \"Daughter of the Dragon\" may have been B-movie pulp, it enabled Wong to show off her talent by delivering a powerful performance.","prompt_id":"a9a8696c28ade7a3f9e0b3d8d97abb862ed987239887e988a2dd21cee1915cb2","messages":[{"content":"Give me this text condensed into just three to four sentences:\n\nShe moved to Europe in 1928, where she made movies in the UK and Germany.

According to her biographer Graham Russell Gao Hodges, Wong hobnobbed with \"an intellectual elite that included princes, playwrights, artists and photographers who clamored to work with her.\" Anna May Wong was featured in magazines all over the world, far more than actresses of a similar level of accomplishment. She became a media superstar, and her coiffure and complexion were copied, while \"coolie coats\" became the rage. According to Hodges, \"[S]he was the one American star who spoke to the French people, more than Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford or Mary Pickford, the top American actresses of the time.\" But, ironically, \"[S]he's the one who's now forgotten.\" Wong was cast in Ewald Andr\u00e9 Dupont's silent film Piccadilly (1929) as a maid who is fired from her job at a London nightclub after dancing on top of a table, then rehired as a dancer to infuse the club with exotic glamour. Her first talkie was The Flame of Love (1930) (aka \"The Road to Dishonour\", although some sources claim it was \"Song\" aka \"Wasted Love\" in that same year), which was released by British International Pictures. In a time before dubbing, when different versions of a single film were filmed in different languages, Wong played in the English, French and German versions of the movie.\n\nParamount Pictures offered her a contract with the promise of lead roles in major productions. Returning to the US in 1930, Wong appeared on Broadway in the play \"On the Spot.\" It was a hit, running for 167 performances, and she moved on to Hollywood and Paramount, where she starred in an adaptation of Sax Rohmer's novel \"Daughter of Fu Manchu\" called Daughter of the Dragon (1931). She was back in stereotype-land, this time as the ultimate \"Dragon Lady,\" who with her father Fu Manchu (played by ethnic Swede Warner Oland, the future Charlie Chan) embodied the evil \"Yellow Peril.\" While \"Daughter of the Dragon\" may have been B-movie pulp, it enabled Wong to show off her talent by delivering a powerful performance.","role":"user"},{"content":"Anna Wong moved to Europe to escape stereotype casting, making her debut in London, and hired a tutor to help her improve her speech. She eventually moved to Germany and learned German and French. She was featured in many magazines and became a media darling.

{"prompt":"Turn the pasted text into a 10-question quiz that has answers.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize the symptoms of schizophrenia and seek help as early as possible. People with schizophrenia are usually diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 30, after the first episode of psychosis. Starting treatment as soon as possible following the first episode of psychosis is an important step toward recovery. However, research shows that gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often appear before the first episode of psychosis. Schizophrenia is rare in younger children.\n\nSchizophrenia symptoms can differ from person to person, but they generally fall into three main categories: psychotic, negative, and cognitive.\n\nPsychotic symptoms include changes in the way a person thinks, acts, and experiences the world. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality with others and experience the world in a distorted way. For some people, these symptoms come and go. For others, the symptoms become stable over time. Psychotic symptoms include:\n\nHallucinations: When a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels things that are not actually there. Hearing voices is common for people with schizophrenia. People who hear voices may hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem.\nDelusions: When a person has strong beliefs that are not true and may seem irrational to others. For example, individuals experiencing delusions may believe that people on the radio and television are sending special messages that require a certain response, or they may believe that they are in danger or that others are trying to hurt them.\nThought disorder: When a person has ways of thinking that are unusual or illogical. People with thought disorder may have trouble organizing their thoughts and speech. Sometimes a person will stop talking in the middle of a thought, jump from topic to topic, or make up words that have no meaning.\nMovement disorder: When a person exhibits abnormal body movements. People with movement disorder may repeat certain motions over and over.\nNegative symptoms include loss of motivation, loss of interest or enjoyment in daily activities, withdrawal from social life, difficulty showing emotions, and difficulty functioning normally.\n\nNegative symptoms include:\n\nHaving trouble planning and sticking with activities, such as grocery shopping\nHaving trouble anticipating and feeling pleasure in everyday life\nTalking in a dull voice and showing limited facial expression\nAvoiding social interaction or interacting in socially awkward ways\nHaving very low energy and spending a lot of time in passive activities. In extreme cases, a person might stop moving or talking for a while, which is a rare condition called catatonia.\nThese symptoms are sometimes mistaken for symptoms of depression or other mental illnesses.\n\nCognitive symptoms include problems in attention, concentration, and memory. These symptoms can make it hard to follow a conversation, learn new things, or remember appointments. A person\u2019s level of cognitive functioning is one of the best predictors of their day-to-day functioning. Health care providers evaluate cognitive functioning using specific tests.\n\nCognitive symptoms include:\n\nHaving trouble processing information to make decisions\nHaving trouble using information immediately after learning it\nHaving trouble focusing or paying attention\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recognized that having certain mental disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, can make people more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.

I just want to paint and create and push my ideas into the world. We'll see where I end up after all. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

Let's start by finding a comfortable position\u2014perhaps seated with crossed legs, reclined, or maybe sprawled on your couch in front of the television with a bowl of popcorn on your lap\u2014whatever stance will best support you in emptying your mind.\n\nNow let\u2019s close our eyes and start to turn inward. If you feel immediately overwhelmed by feelings of guilt and self-loathing, that\u2019s a sign you\u2019re a mediocre or possibly bad person and you\u2019ve turned too far inward, so dial it back a little. Focus on the sensation of breathing. How does it feel to fill the lungs with air and then release it all? If this sensation is uncomfortable, it\u2019s possible you're actually a vampire or supernatural being that doesn't thrive on oxygen; if so, don\u2019t panic. Close this video and search our home page for a video titled \"Guided meditation for sentient beings who do not breathe.\"\n\nIf you\u2019re still with me, let\u2019s begin a practice of progressive relaxation. Starting with the toes, we\u2019ll scan the body for areas that are holding tension and manually relax them. How? I\u2019m afraid there's no simple answer\u2014just try to relax these muscles, and if they resist, impose your will by force. You might ask your doctor about a prescription for muscle relaxers.\n\nLet's bring attention to areas of the body that tend to be ignored. What does it feel like to release tension from your belly button? How does it feel to have relaxed fingernails? I\u2019m seriously asking\u2014this is not a rhetorical question. My manicurist says my fingernails exhibit symptoms of PTSD. Drop a comment below to reply. Please. I\u2019m desperate.\n\nNow we'll draw our meditation to a close. Open your eyes slowly.\n\nAs you may be aware, this meditation hasn\u2019t done anything to solve the world\u2019s problems, improve your lot in life, or remedy the hurt you've caused others, but it should have at least helped you feel better about these problems without actually lifting a finger to change anything. So I hope you\u2019ll like this video, subscribe, and join us for another guided meditation tomorrow so you can continue to feel superficially at peace about the impending apocalypse and evil impulses simmering quietly inside your soul. Namaste.\u00a0","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Wouldn't it be great if there was a machine that could crack the earth just like an egg? I certainly believe so. That's why I made these plans here . . . *pulls up blueprints for an intricately designed machine* . . . for what I lovingly call the Crust Cracker 5000.

And boy, are there a lot of them. I can say with 99% certainty that the Crust Cracker 5000 takes care of every single one. Taxes? Gone. Debt? Wiped. That annoying hangnail that you just can't get rid of right now without feeling like you're tearing off all the skin on your finger? Absolutely obliterated. Literally, any problem you can think of would be solved quickly and humanely with the Crust Cracker 5000.

Where exactly does it go? Let me be the first to assure you that none of it goes into our pockets. We are purely a non-profit organization. Every cent we make is being put directly into the development of the Crust Cracker 5000. For example, let's take a look at this section of our prototype. In my demonstration, the action performed by this piece was done with a spoon. Think of this as a bigger spoon. Unfortunately, Crust Cracker 1 through Crust Cracker 4999 has failed at this point. We just can't get a spoon big enough to generate enough force to crack this planet open. With your money, we could get the tools we need to add to the existing Crust Cracker platform and really get to that good magma goo in the mantle.

Write a Strong Thesis: A thesis is an articulate statement of your central argument. Write your thesis sooner rather than later to focus your research and write around a central point without being distracted by tangential ideas.\n2. Create an Outline: Writing an outline fleshes out the core ideas in your essay, helping you to focus on each section and the relevant data\/quotes when you write your rough draft. \n3. Use and Cite Outside Sources: Most college essays necessitate some level of research, and in order for your paper to be compelling, you will need to support your claims using quotes and, in some cases, statistics and data. Find a reputable source that provides helpful, relevant information that you can quote or incorporate to develop your writing. Just be certain to cite any sources you include, whether those sources are direct or indirect.\n4. Create a Rough Draft: A rough draft translates your outline into a structured essay with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.\n5. Proofread: Proofreading is important even for the most accomplished writer. Review your paper carefully, both editorially and structurally. Correct grammar and punctuation as you go and make sure that the structure of your essay is cohesive, relevant, and compelling.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Not having ever heard of a restaurant like this, I decided to check it out. \n\nThe place was well-lit when I entered, though the decor was far too eccentric for my liking. The idea for a shoe-themed restaurant with shoes on the wall is a decent idea if used in moderation. I feel like Laces took it a bit too far. My disappointment did not end there. With no host or hostess, I needed to find my own seating. This can be fine in certain establishments, but here the options were extremely limited given the size of the dining room. \n\nOnce seated, I spent upwards of thirty minutes waiting for service. I did think, at one point, that it was a buffet. I grabbed something off of a table and brought it back to my seat, but it was impossible to cut through, and something stringy kept getting stuck in my teeth. Without any staff presenting themselves to me, I asked to speak with the manager. The manager tried to tell me that they don't have any food at Laces, which is of course ridiculous since I found it online and the internet never tells lies. I left hungry and angry. Heed my warning. Do not eat at Laces. Anyone going there for a romantic night out or a relaxing bite after work will be sorely disappointed. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

New York City Marathon\nNew York is a major city in the United States as well as the world. Its marathon is no different. Each year, the New York Marathon brings in up to 50,000 runners. The starting places are strictly regulated, however, and there is a split quota between New York residents, Americans, and anyone else. This means your chances are slim if you are not from New York or America, but you can purchase tickets with a tour company, which may be the best way for non-USA citizens to attend. The marathon is run around early November, and anyone over 18 is welcome to apply.\n\n2. Chicago\nStaying in America, the next marathon on the list is Chicago, which is in the state of Illinois. Regularly drawing 40,000 participants, the Chicago marathon is a great way to push yourself to the limit and see one of the United States' most populous cities. It is a bit easier to get a ticket for the Chicago marathon with no qualifying times and an entry age of just 16. The registration closes at a max of 45,000. The Chicago marathon takes place in mid-October.\n\n3. Paris\nThe city of love, Paris, is an incredible place full of sights, smells, and sounds. In early April, it is also the host of the third-largest marathon in the world. About 40,000 descend on France's capital to test themselves in the streets where Napoleon used to walk. Entry differs from the USA marathons, with participants needing a sports health certificate signed by a doctor. You can apply online or in writing; the minimum age is 18.\n\n4. London\nA historical city like no other, London hosts one of the most sought-after marathons in mid-April each year and boasts around 35,000 crossing the finish line each year. Any foreigners will struggle to get a starting place for this famous race, with 7% as the reported number for how many foreigners finish each year. The best and easiest way to get a ticket for the London marathon is to purchase one through a travel agent.\n\n5. Berlin\nWhere better to run 26.2 miles than the German capital of Berlin? Take in the war monuments seemingly on every corner while you compete with a limited 40,000 people to get around Berlin the most quickly. As with the London marathon, the best way to get a ticket for the Berlin marathon is through a travel agent or charity provider.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Construction began in 1930, it was dedicated in 1935, and hydroelectric generators went online in 1937. The dam was built for $49 million then, and the power plant and generators cost an additional $71 million.

The brim of his tan hat covered his eyes, and a poncho draped around his shoulders. The wind whistled through the bar bringing in a flurry of snow with it. Jaywicks watched the man as he moved slowly towards the bar. He was hunched over dragging something heavy. Setting down the glass he had been cleaning, Jaywick leaned over the bar top to survey the man's burden. \n\"He dead?\"\n\"Ought to be. I put six shots of lead into him.\" Hardwick nodded as he picked up the glass and continued to clean it. \n\"And why exactly did you feel the need to drag a dead body into my bar on this winter's night?\" The man placed a dull coin on the bar and gestured towards a bottle of whisky on the shelf behind the barman. Hardwick thought for a second before placing down the whisky glass and filling it. He slid it over to the man. He thought it better not to deny the gentleman the simple pleasure of a drink. After all, maybe the frozen corpse on the floor was the last bartender to turn him down. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

{"prompt":"Reduce this article from 488 to less than 150 words by summarizing and focusing on the essential facts.\n\nIn this fact sheet, students will learn about the people who became actors, what an average day was like and more.\n\nActors\n\nThe life of an actor changed dramatically during Shakespeare\u2019s lifetime. At first actors toured in companies, travelling the country to perform in towns and cities and in private homes. By the time Shakespeare died, London had several permanent theatres where the actors performed, drawing in huge audiences. Yet, despite the popularity of play-going, the acting profession had a bad reputation. Actors were seen as unruly and a threat to a peaceful society.\n\nWho became an actor?\n\nIn Shakespeare\u2019s time acting was a profession only open to boys and men. Women were acting elsewhere in Europe but they were not allowed to perform in public theatres in England until 1660. In an Elizabethan production boys would play the female parts, like Ophelia in Hamlet or Desdemona in Othello, whilst occasionally men would play the older women. There were many more actors working across the country at the time, but these are some of the best known Elizabethan actors: Richard Burbage, Edward Alleyn, Robert Armin, William Kemp and Nathan Field.\n\nWhat was an actor\u2019s training?\n\nMany actors began their careers as young boys. They could join a company as an apprentice and be taught by one of the more senior actors within the company. Actors were expected to be able to sword fight, sing and dance, as well as having a good memory for learning lines.\n\nHow big was a company?\n\nCompany sizes varied, depending on where the company was working and how wealthy the company was. A wealthy company, when working in a theatre, might have 8\u2013 12 senior members called sharers, 3\u20134 boys, a number of hired players (hired men) and then stage hands, tiremen (who would help the actors dress back stage) and some musicians. Actors would join a company under the patronage of a monarch (like the Queen\u2019s Men) or a nobleman, such as the Lord Admiral\u2019s Men or the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Men. \n\nWhere did a company work?\n\nMost companies were based in London, using one of the permanent theatres. Sometimes the theatres were closed, for example when there was a plague in the city, and so companies would then go on tour. Mostly they toured England, but companies did also go abroad, particularly to the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nWhat did an actor earn?\n\nMany theatre companies operated a shareholder system. Sharers in a company earned more than the hired men. Shakespeare was a sharer of the Chamberlain\u2019s Men, later the King\u2019s Men, and so shared the costs and also the profits the company made. Actors\u2019 earnings also depended on where the company was playing. The company made more money in London than in the country, so could pay actors higher wages. In 1597 the actor William Kendall was paid 10 shillings a week in London but only 5 shillings in the country.\n\n","prompt_id":"86ad87691e5725d33d686118811d13876d192cf7525fb83c9e2434ee6d71be56","messages":[{"content":"Reduce this article from 488 to less than 150 words by summarizing and focusing on the essential facts.\n\nIn this fact sheet, students will learn about the people who became actors, what an average day was like and more.\n\nActors\n\nThe life of an actor changed dramatically during Shakespeare\u2019s lifetime.

They should have met at dawn because Hannah said that was the correct time for duels, but Bella refused to get up so early. The duel was, therefore, set for nine o'clock. Neither Hannah nor Lizzie slept that night, but each was quietly sure she would win. Hannah had been practicing calling Vanilla to her for weeks, and Vanilla was pretty good at it now. She knew that when Lizzie had had the puppy, it was too young to train - Vanilla couldn't possibly go to Lizzie. But Vanilla could sometimes be naughty. Could she be sure? \n\nAt the corner shop, Hannah bought a pouch of aniseed balls and put them in her pocket where the smell would surely be carried on her hands: dogs were supposed to find aniseed irresistible. 'I did want some anyway,' Hannah told herself. But it wasn't true - she would never have bought aniseed balls for herself. Hannah was really cheating. \n\nLizzie wished she hadn't agreed to a duel, but she couldn't get out of it now. She let Hannah take Fudge - her name for the puppy - home that night because she reckoned that Fudge would rush to greet her and not go to Hannah. But she had no qualms about putting a piece of raw steak in her pocket. It felt horrible, and she knew she would get into trouble with Bella over it. Well, too bad; this was an emergency. \n\nHannah had written out the rules carefully on a bit of paper. She read them out in her thin, clear voice. One or two people stopped to watch, but when some children ran into the dueling area, Bella shoed them away. The two girls would stand forty paces apart, with Bella in the middle holding the puppy. Then, when they were ready, Bella would give the signal and let go. Neither Lizzie nor Hannah was allowed to move, but they would each call the puppy's name. Whichever of them she ran to would be the winner and the puppy's owner. Bella was the judge, and her decision was final. \n\n'Twenty paces, then,' said Hannah. They counted out the steps and turned to face each other. Bella looked at both the girls to check they were ready. First one, and then the other nodded. 'Now!' Bella said and let go.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

It was a cool day, but that didn't faze him at all. The wind danced over his bald head, and tussled his limp and greasy hair.\n\nNigel was in a fantastic mood today. He felt truly alive for the first time in 40 years. As an accountant, there wasn't a huge amount of variation or interest in his work. Numbers came in, and these days robots did all the work. Never mind, Nigel kept walking. \n\nHe recalled better times when his hair had been thicker and his belly tighter. He was the master of the calculator, a colossal computer that sang machine rhythm for him and him alone. \n\nIn a way, Nigel reflected, he had been the architect of his own downfall. He made a machine that made him redundant. It doesn't even make him rich. But that's Luddite nonsense. If you're a plow maker, making a plow-making machine doesn't make you redundant, it makes your job more ... future-y. \n\nThe road bent and he could see the long straight of the beach up ahead. Long straight gravel road. Long straight horizon. He smelled the salty sea air. \n\nHe managed to get to the little place after Marg passed. She had never wanted to live at the beach, and that was fair. It is inconvenient to be so far from the semblance of civilization, but there it was. The sea. \n\nThe sea called to Nigel. When he was young, it had called him away to America. When he was finished getting his fancy degrees, it called him home. Now the sea called to him again, so Nigel kept walking.  \n\nThe crunch of gravel gave way to the soft pushing of buffalo grass, then the squish-crunch of sand. The bay embraced him in a grey arc, bounded on both ends by tall, withering cliffs. \n\nNigel walked a little further and felt his loafers dampen with the salt water. Soon he felt his knees and skin prickle with the lapping water. Then his cardigan got wet. Then his grizzled chin and his lank hair became the playthings of the sea. \n\nNigel kept walking.

Make a rope from a vine and swing across, Tarzan style: The player could command the character to make a rope from a vine and swing across.

Make a running jump: The most straightforward option, the character could run as fast as possible and attempt to leap across the chasm. However, they may not be able to clear the gap, falling down the chasm to their peril. They could also simply trip some distance before the chasm. This may be useful if you do not wish to incur a \"game over\" screen for this rash decision by the player.\n3. Lay a log across the chasm: The player could command the character to look for a suitably long log to balance across the chasm. Alternatively, they could attempt to chop down a tree over the chasm. This would not work if the tree was of insignificant length to cover the gap or if the character was not strong enough to lift up and drop a sufficiently long log. \n4. Look for a way around: The player could command the character to simply walk along the chasm until they find a way across. This could fail if there is no way across, or if the path across is visible but not accessible. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a rapidly moving river or a significant elevation difference. \n5. Acquire a vehicle: The player could command the character to look for a vehicle. This would not be a successful solution if they failed to find a vehicle capable of crossing the chasm or if the vehicle that they found was not in working order.

These atomic clocks use the vibrations of atoms to keep time with extreme accuracy, thereby providing a much more consistent measure of time than methods based on the rotation of our planet or its revolution around the sun.\n\nCoordinated Universal Time is the time standard used in aviation, computing, navigation, weather forecasting, and many other fields. Unlike TAI, which is purely atomic in nature, UTC is closely aligned with mean solar time (a modern replacement for Greenwich Mean Time) and accounts for variations in Earth's rotational speed by occasionally introducing \"leap seconds\". While TAI ticks away uniformly, the Earth's rotation gradually slows down over time. This means that UTC, which is pegged to the Earth's rotation, occasionally falls out of sync with TAI. To correct this, a \"leap second\" is added to UTC approximately every 18 months, although the exact timing is determined by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

Jewelry: Gold's exceptional lustre and resistance to tarnish due to its inert nature have rendered it a preferred choice for crafting jewelry for millennia. Over half of the gold consumed today is converted into jewelry. Gold is both ductile and malleable, which enables it to be shaped into intricate designs that retain their form and beauty over substantial periods. Its chemical inertness ensures it remains unaffected by most chemicals, thereby preserving its aesthetic appeal even after prolonged use.\n2. Investment: Gold serves as a tangible asset that conserves its value over time, making it a popular choice as a financial hedge against inflation and currency instability. This is in part due to its limited availability \u2013 the cumulative quantity of gold mined throughout human history would fill merely about three Olympic-sized swimming pools. Gold's easy storability and globally recognized value also make it a sought-after asset during times of economic instability.\n3. Electronics: With its superior electrical conductivity and high resistance to corrosion and tarnish, gold plays an invaluable role in electronics, accounting for approximately 10% of global gold use. Gold is integral to a variety of electronic devices, encompassing smartphones, GPS units, televisions, and computers. In these applications, gold is typically employed in connectors, switch and relay contacts, soldered joints, and bonding wires.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Open QA"}

These ideas take into account your openness to most things, your love of outdoor activities, and the fact that you aren't religious. Each idea includes a description so that you can better understand whether or not you'd be open to it: \n\n1. Sports Leagues. Given your interest in being active outdoors, consider joining a recreational sports league. Search online or ask around at your workplace or gym to see what leagues are available to join. Pick a sport you think you might enjoy and choose a league that is appropriate for your anticipated skill level. Joining a sports league is a great way to get outside, engage in friendly competition, and most importantly, meet new people. \n2. Volunteering. Pretty much every city should have volunteer organizations where you can donate your time. Volunteering is not only a great way to give back and help those in need, but it's also a perfect way to connect with other volunteers and bond over your shared commitment to helping others. Make sure to look for a volunteer opportunity that suits your schedule, isn't too far from where you live, and is something that you will ultimately find fulfilling. Also, consider an opportunity that allows you to spend the majority of your time outside given your love of outdoor activities. \n3. Book Club. If you are someone who enjoys reading and discussing what you're reading with others, consider joining a book club. Book clubs are often organized monthly and involve meeting as a group to discuss a particular book that's been designated for that month. Not only will you get to read and talk about an interesting selection of new books, but joining a book club is a perfect way to expand your social circle and get to know a large group of people who share your interest. \n4. Running Groups. As someone who enjoys outdoor activities, you may want to consider joining an organized running group. A common practice in such groups is to go on fun runs that take place in different places around the city. It may not seem like you can easily get to know people by running with them, but rest assured that there is usually socialization at a restaurant, cafe, or brewery before or after the run, which makes it a great opportunity to get to know new people.\n5. Trivia Nights. It's extremely common for bars to host trivia nights on specific nights of the week in order to provide a fun group activity for their customers. Make sure to look for one that's geared toward matching up strangers instead of expecting people to come in their own groups.   \n\nI hope that you are able to utilize these suggestions to make some new friends in your city.

{"prompt":"Write an executive summary of the attached biography of Lillian Gish that focuses on her professional achievements rather than her private life.\n\nLillian Diana Gish was born on October 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio. Her father, James Lee Gish, was an alcoholic who caroused, was rarely at home, and left the family to, more or less, fend for themselves. To help make ends meet, Lillian, her sister Dorothy Gish, and their mother, Mary Gish, a.k.a. Mary Robinson McConnell, tried their hand at acting in local productions. Lillian was six years old when she first appeared in front of an audience. For the next 13 years, she and Dorothy appeared before stage audiences with great success. Had she not made her way into films, Lillian quite possibly could have been one of the great stage actresses of all time; however, she found her way onto the big screen when, in 1912, she met famed director D.W. Griffith. Impressed with what he saw, he immediately cast her in her first film, An Unseen Enemy (1912), followed by The One She Loved (1912) and My Baby (1912). She would make 12 films for Griffith in 1912. With 25 films in the next two years, Lillian's exposure to the public was so great that she fast became one of the top stars in the industry, right alongside Mary Pickford, \"America's Sweetheart\".\n\nIn 1915, Lillian starred as Elsie Stoneman in Griffith's most ambitious project to date, The Birth of a Nation (1915). She was not making the large number of films that she had been in the beginning because she was successful and popular enough to be able to pick and choose the right films to appear in. The following year, she appeared in another Griffith classic, Intolerance (1916). By the early 1920s, her career was on its way down. As with anything else, be it sports or politics, new faces appeared on the scene to replace the \"old\", and Lillian was no different. In fact, she did not appear at all on the screen in 1922, 1925 or 1929. However, 1926 was her busiest year of the decade with roles in La Boh\u00e8me (1926) and The Scarlet Letter (1926). As the decade wound to a close, \"talkies\" were replacing silent films. However, Lillian was not idle during her time away from the screen. She appeared in stage productions, to the acclaim of the public and critics alike. In 1933, she filmed His Double Life (1933), but did not make another film for nine years.\n\nWhen she returned in 1943, she appeared in two big-budget pictures, Commandos Strike at Dawn (1942) and Top Man (1943). Although these roles did not bring her the attention she had had in her early career, Lillian still proved she could hold her own with the best of them. She earned an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her role of Laura Belle McCanles in Duel in the Sun (1946), but lost to Anne Baxter in The Razor's Edge (1946).\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed roles of her career came in the thriller The Night of the Hunter (1955), also notable as the only film directed by actor Charles Laughton. In 1969, she published her autobiography, \"The Movies, Mr. Griffith, and Me\". In 1987, she made what was to be her last motion picture, The Whales of August (1987), a box-office success that exposed her to a new generation of fans. Her 75-year career is almost unbeatable in any field, let alone the film industry. On February 27, 1993, at age 99, Lillian Gish died peacefully in her sleep at her Manhattan apartment in New York City. She never married.","prompt_id":"91c266537d1b7b14576858b3cffc0e0c64e067f25fc427b1ccd9f57deb3ab510","messages":[{"content":"Write an executive summary of the attached biography of Lillian Gish that focuses on her professional achievements rather than her private life.\n\nLillian Diana Gish was born on October 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio.

In fact, she did not appear at all on the screen in 1922, 1925 or 1929. However, 1926 was her busiest year of the decade with roles in La Boh\u00e8me (1926) and The Scarlet Letter (1926). As the decade wound to a close, \"talkies\" were replacing silent films. However, Lillian was not idle during her time away from the screen. She appeared in stage productions, to the acclaim of the public and critics alike. In 1933, she filmed His Double Life (1933), but did not make another film for nine years.\n\nWhen she returned in 1943, she appeared in two big-budget pictures, Commandos Strike at Dawn (1942) and Top Man (1943). Although these roles did not bring her the attention she had had in her early career, Lillian still proved she could hold her own with the best of them. She earned an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her role of Laura Belle McCanles in Duel in the Sun (1946), but lost to Anne Baxter in The Razor's Edge (1946).\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed roles of her career came in the thriller The Night of the Hunter (1955), also notable as the only film directed by actor Charles Laughton. In 1969, she published her autobiography, \"The Movies, Mr. Griffith, and Me\". In 1987, she made what was to be her last motion picture, The Whales of August (1987), a box-office success that exposed her to a new generation of fans. Her 75-year career is almost unbeatable in any field, let alone the film industry. On February 27, 1993, at age 99, Lillian Gish died peacefully in her sleep at her Manhattan apartment in New York City. She never married.","role":"user"},{"content":"Lillian Gish (1893\u20131993) was born in Springfield, Ohio. She began acting at age 6 in local productions. In 1912, she met director D.W.

This is an out-and-back 9.7-mile hike in the Many Glacier area of the park. The elevation gain is 1,275 feet, and the trail is rated as moderate. You'll begin with a steep uphill section, but after that, the trail levels out. This hike is an all-day event, but it is worth the effort. Pack a lunch, and enjoy some quiet time as you take in the glacier in all of its glory. The trail can be busy during the summer, but due to its length, it's not as popular as some other trails. Once you arrive at the lake, keep following the trail around to the left and you'll find some nice private spots where you can escape the crowds. Don't forget your swimsuit or a change of clothes - it's hard to resist jumping in the bone-chilling water to cool off. \n\n2. Day Two.\nMorning: Hike to Virginia Falls. At 3.6 miles roundtrip and only about 525 feet of elevation gain, this is a hike that gives you a lot of bang for your buck. You'll see St. Mary falls along the way, which is a beautiful waterfall with strikingly blue water, and you'll also see smaller unnamed falls around almost every turn as you get closer to Virginia Falls. \n\nAfternoon: Hike the Trail of the Cedars and keep going to Avalanche Lake. This laid-back hike starts with the Trail of the Cedars, a short 1-mile boardwalk trail that offers some lovely views. You'll eventually reach a sign that points to another trail that will take you to Avalanche Lake. The hike to this lake is 4.5 miles out-and-back with about 760 feet of elevation gain. It's well worth the effort because at the end you're rewarded with a gorgeous view of the lake and a stunning mountain backdrop. The way the light hits the mountains in the late afternoon and early evening is beautiful, and you may avoid the crowds a bit by starting later in the day. Look closely - you may even see some waterfalls in those mountains!\n\n3. Day Three.\nAll Day: Hike to Grinnell Glacier. While this hike can be made easier by taking a boat to shave off 3.4 miles of hiking, the first part of the trail is flat and offers views that are worth the extra mileage. The hike is 10.6 miles long in total, with an elevation gain of about 1,600 feet. It's the most strenuous hike on this itinerary. You'll start off walking around Swiftcurrent Lake and Lake Josephine. Then the climbing starts, and the views just keep getting better. Start the trail early so you can take your time and enjoy a rest once you make it to Grinnell Glacier. The hike is popular, but there's a lot to explore once you reach the glacier. Don't just stop where the trail ends - keep walking around the edge of the lake to find a nice spot to sit back and enjoy the view you worked so hard for!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

This cordless drill has a 1\/2-inch chuck bit\u2014unusual for drills of this voltage\u2014that securely held all the bits and drivers throughout our testing. While this model works well for light projects, we found that it\u2019s not quite as effective on bigger holes and might stall sometimes, making it best suited for the occasional quick job.

All in all, this pick is ideal for homeowners and renters alike who need an affordable cordless drill for occasional use. In the past decade, cordless drills have become more powerful, lighter, and energy-efficient, making corded drills practically obsolete.\n\nIf so, we made sure that everything fit properly and considered any additional features (like space for extra accessories and included drill or driver bits). If you have small hands or know you\u2019ll be using your drill for hours on end, consider a more lightweight option like this one from Bosch. It\u2019s an easy-to-carry drill that you won\u2019t get tired of holding, and it has two speed settings and a high torque so you can tackle numerous projects with ease.

In the beginning, the business activities mainly concerned selling and repairing electric power tools; however, in 1958, they began manufacturing power tools. Twenty years later, in 1978, Makita introduced its first cordless power tool, the 7.2V Cordless Drill. An impact driver is mostly a heavy-duty screwdriver for repetitive or more extensive screwdriver projects.\n\nFor this metric, we used 5-inch long, \u00bd-inch lag screws and standard wood screws, scoring each tool on the ease and speed at which it drove the different screws in. The Makita XFD14Z did exceptionally well, earning one of the makita cordless drill best scores of the entire group. We translate those readings into scores for power, speed, and run time. We also incorporate ratings for predicted reliability and owner satisfaction based on data from CR\u2019s member surveys.\n\nThe expansive breadth-of-line of the Makita 18V LXT\u00ae Series means an 18V battery from any LXT\u00ae tool will power the Sub-Compact Driver-Drill.

In the past decade, cordless drills have become more powerful, lighter, and energy-efficient, making corded drills practically obsolete.\n\nIf so, we made sure that everything fit properly and considered any additional features (like space for extra accessories and included drill or driver bits). If you have small hands or know you\u2019ll be using your drill for hours on end, consider a more lightweight option like this one from Bosch. It\u2019s an easy-to-carry drill that you won\u2019t get tired of holding, and it has two speed settings and a high torque so you can tackle numerous projects with ease. Despite its small size, this cordless drill still delivered an impressive performance in our tests.\n\nThe company was founded in 1915, in Japan, under the name \u201cMakita Denski Seisakusho\u201d. In the beginning, the business activities mainly concerned selling and repairing electric power tools; however, in 1958, they began manufacturing power tools. Twenty years later, in 1978, Makita introduced its first cordless power tool, the 7.2V Cordless Drill. An impact driver is mostly a heavy-duty screwdriver for repetitive or more extensive screwdriver projects.\n\nFor this metric, we used 5-inch long, \u00bd-inch lag screws and standard wood screws, scoring each tool on the ease and speed at which it drove the different screws in. The Makita XFD14Z did exceptionally well, earning one of the makita cordless drill best scores of the entire group. We translate those readings into scores for power, speed, and run time. We also incorporate ratings for predicted reliability and owner satisfaction based on data from CR\u2019s member surveys.\n\nThe expansive breadth-of-line of the Makita 18V LXT\u00ae Series means an 18V battery from any LXT\u00ae tool will power the Sub-Compact Driver-Drill. The XFD11ZB has an efficient brushless motor with 2 speed settings and dual L.E.D. lights to illuminate the work area. (with battery, sold separately) it\u2019s a drilling and driving solution with superior comfort makita angle grinder and handling. The Makita 18V LXT\u00ae Lithium-Ion Brushless Cordless \u00bd\u201d Driver-Drill Kit (XFD12T) is an ideal drilling and driving solution for the user who wants a drill with superior power-to-weight ratio. Of Max Torque with an efficient brushless motor that delivers up 50% more work per charge, increased power and speed, and longer tool life.\n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"The Makita DTD152Z 18v LXT Impact Driver has 2 rotation settings, forward and reverse.

Here are some facts about why cats are better than dogs: \n1. Purring. This is something cats do that dogs are not physically capable of doing. It has also been proven that purring can lower your stress levels and your blood pressure. \n2. Quieter. A cat isn't going to howl at the moon, bark at anyone who knocks at the door, or anything else. While a cat might meow on occasion, they are much quieter than dogs. \n3. Less Care. Even though cats do have litterboxes, this is far less trouble than having to walk a dog every day and give it plenty of exercise. You also don't have to take a cat outside to use the bathroom when it is raining outside. \n4. Less Space. Cats do not need huge amounts of space. Even if you want to set up a play area for them, this can be vertical instead of sprawled out over the floor. Also, cat toys are usually smaller than dog toys, and a cat will take up less space on your bed than most dogs will. \n5. Less Food. Cats don't eat as much food as dogs do, so their food lasts longer and will probably be cheaper than a dog's food. \n6. Less Destruction. A bored cat is far less likely to damage something it shouldn't. This is compared to dogs, who might chew on the furniture or any number of other things. \n7. Cleaner. Cats rarely need baths due to the fact that they do a great job of keeping themselves clean. They certainly aren't going to be playing in the mud or tracking dirt into the house, even if you let them outside. \nI hope this can help put an end to your argument.

I liked the new house and was happy that we had been able to find it. Rentals were hard to come by. One thing that bugged me though was the intercom unit on the second-floor landing. I kept telling my spouse that I was going to take it down. She kept laughing and saying emphatically, \"Don't bother it!\" one Saturday morning, I decided it was time to act. I gathered some screwdrivers, pliers, and wire cutters to attack the project. I carefully took all of the screws out of the plate holding it on the wall. I pulled it away from the wall and found red and white wires attached to the back of it. I wasn't sure what to do. I picked up the wire cutters and decided to snip the wires. As I cut through them, there was a loud popping noise, the lights in our house blinked twice, and then everything went dark. I heard my wife yell, \"What are you doing up there?\" I looked down at the wire cutters in my hand and was thankful that they had rubber handles or that might've been my very last home improvement project. I decided that from then on, I would take my wife's advice.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Add some antioxidants, proteins, fiber, and anti-inflammatories, and you\u2019ve got a healthier, more robust tortilla chip.\n\nBut does it taste different? Some aficionados swear these darker chips have a nuanced, nutty flavor you just don\u2019t get with the usual yellow. Others?

Maintaining this, he never saw his coworkers attempting to gain his attention via flailing arms. If he had given them his attention, they surely would have made certain Clay knew who he was talking to and, possibly, might have kept him from making any further mistakes.\n\nSince the attempt had failed, Clay continued his normal behavior. He returned to his grill station and produced his spatula from his rear pocket. The health inspector never saw him pick up any utensils, so Clay must have taken the spatula into the bathroom with him. Purely disgusted, the health inspector walked over to Clay\u2019s station to continue his assessment.\n\n\u201cIf you want a burger,\u201d Clay rolled his eyes and turned away, \u201cyou are going to have to put an order in up front. However, when you do that, make sure they tell me who it is for so I can prepare it special, just for you.\u201d The health inspector, assuming Clay\u2019s special burger was nothing anyone would want to consume, realized Clay was not fit to serve food to the public. Finally, the stranger pulled his wallet from a coat pocket and revealed his credentials. Clay could not believe it. In shock, his mouth stayed open long enough for a thin stream of drool to fall from his mouth and land on the cooktop. \u201cI will be sure to include this in the report, too.\u201d grinned the health inspector.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

This absence greatly impacts its surface temperature, leading to one of the most extreme thermal environments in the solar system. During the lunar daytime, the surface temperature can rise to around 253 degrees Fahrenheit. Conversely, in the lunar nighttime, the temperature can drop as low as -243 degrees Fahrenheit. The stark contrast is due to the absence of an atmosphere, which on Earth helps distribute heat and mitigate temperature extremes. These intense temperature swings present significant challenges for human exploration and potential habitation. For astronauts, their spacesuits must be designed to withstand these temperature extremes. Similarly, equipment and habitation structures would need to be resilient to such temperatures. These temperatures can cause materials to expand and contract, potentially leading to structural failure over time.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Open QA"}

Change your address with all government agencies - \n\nThere are a few government agencies you will need to notify when you move. Places such as the post office or social security office are a good place to start. Other institutions you may need to notify include your pension plan or the DMV. \n\n2. Change your address with all healthcare services and providers - \n\nIf you plan to stay with the same healthcare providers, all you will need to do is request to update your files with your new address. However, suppose you are moving farther away and transferring to a new doctor. In that case, you must obtain your medical records from your previous providers, such as your doctor, dentist, veterinarian, and other specialists.\n\n3. Change your address with all personal sources and contacts - \n\nThere are several personal sources that you will need to give your change of address to, such as your friends and family members, as well as anyone in your community you want to stay in touch with. You will also need to reach out to any clubs or organizations your children belong to so that they can still be involved with them or join up with a different chapter in their new hometown.\n\n4. Change your address with your insurance companies - \n\nYour insurance providers like your health insurance, life insurance, or auto insurance companies will need to know about your change of address. You can call them and speak with an agent to make sure your information is changed on time. Or, you may also be able to update the information online if possible. If applicable, don't forget to also change your address with other insurance companies such as dental insurance providers or your employment insurance program. \n\n5. Change your address with Utilities and other services if applicable -\n\nThe need to update your address with your utility companies and other service providers depends on if you will still be using the same provider at your new place of residence. Suppose you are moving to a new area where you will use a different company for your electricity or your water. If that is the case, you will need to let your current providers know the exact dates you want your utilities shut off at your old residence. You will also need to let your new providers know when you want your services turned on at your new home. \n\n\n6. Change your address with your financial services - \n\nWith your financial services, along with updating your address, you may also want to consider transferring to a new branch or a different bank entirely if your current provider doesn't have a branch near your new place of residence.

Be sure to notify all of your credit card issuers of your new address. \n\n\n7. Change your address with online services - \n\nYou will also need to update your online profiles and accounts with your various online services.

Suddenly, objects started moving around on their own, seeming to come to her at the first thought of need. Even stranger, the weather seemed to reflect her moods perfectly. After a few days of odd happenings, Felicity turned to her trusty books to find an answer. Although she felt a bit ridiculous looking for books about magic and witchcraft as a rational, modern-day woman, it seemed to be her only option. Surely there must be some truth in the old tales.\nFinally, after weeks of searching, Felicity stumbled across a rare collection of 18th-century grimoires. These otherworldly tomes sent a shiver up her spine, but she knew that inside one of them lay the key to understanding why this was happening to her. \nWhen she brought home the stack of ancient books, Felicity set them down on her end table with a sigh. She couldn't fathom where to begin her search. Then, with a slight growl, Felix jumped up on the table, knocked the stack of books to the floor, walked straight to the one titled The Magus, and sat on the cover. It was almost as if he was trying to tell her something. With a shake of her head, Felicity picked up the book her cat seemed to have chosen, mumbling to herself that it was as good a place to start as any.

{"prompt":"Rewrite this recipe as a story from the perspective of a blender who makes this cheesecake recipe a lot and is friends with some of the ingredients and kitchen tools. Make it interesting to a 3rd grader.\n\nAdjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\n\nMake the crust: If you\u2019re starting out with full graham crackers, use a food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar until combined, and then stir in the melted butter. Mixture will be sandy. Try to smash\/break up any large chunks. Pour into an ungreased 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and partly up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the mixture is no longer crumby\/crumbly and you can use the flat bottom of a small measuring cup to help smooth it all out if needed. Pre-bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.\n\nMake the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.

If you notice the cheesecake browning too quickly on top, tent it with aluminum foil halfway through baking. When it\u2019s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly.

Make it interesting to a 3rd grader.\n\nAdjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\n\nMake the crust: If you\u2019re starting out with full graham crackers, use a food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar until combined, and then stir in the melted butter. Mixture will be sandy. Try to smash\/break up any large chunks. Pour into an ungreased 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and partly up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the mixture is no longer crumby\/crumbly and you can use the flat bottom of a small measuring cup to help smooth it all out if needed. Pre-bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.\n\nMake the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.

The human then turns the knob to 177 degrees Celsius to wait for the cheesecake mixture.\n\nNext, the human takes out a bag of graham crackers and then uses me to blend the crackers into fine crumbs. After the crackers are blended, they are mixed with sugar, which I see a lot. Melted butter is also added to the cracker-sugar mixture. As the mixture is sandy, the human mashes the large chunks and pours the mixture into a cake pan. They apply pressure onto the mixture in the cake pan to make a compact crust. The human should only apply sufficient pressure on the crust till it is no longer crumbly. If they use too much pressure, the cheesecake crust will be very hard to bite into, or so they say. The crust is then baked for 10 minutes and then placed onto a hot pan on a piece of aluminium foil. \n\nNow it's time to make the cheesecake batter! First, the human uses a mixer to beat the cream cheese and, my friend, sugar (again) in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth. Sour cream, vanilla extract and lemon juice are also added to the mixture. Once the mixture is fully combined, the human adds eggs one at a time and beats them into the mixture. The human stops mixing once the last egg is fully incorporated into the batter. It is important not to over-mix the batter as the cheesecake may deflate and crack as it cools.\n\nAfter that, the human boils a pot of water and wraps the pan that holds the crust in a piece of aluminium foil. The aluminium foil-wrapped pan is then placed into the larger pan. The cheesecake batter is poured onto the crust, and once that is done, the human adds the boiling water into the larger pan. The boiling water surrounds the pan with the cheesecake batter and crust. The human then puts the larger pan into the oven.\n\nThe human then turns the oven's timer to around 60 minutes. If the human notices that the cheesecake is browning too quickly at the surface, they would tent it with aluminium foil. Once the cake is baked, the cheesecake will wobble slightly when the pan is gently shaken. The human then turns off the oven and leaves the door open while leaving the cheesecake inside for an hour. The cheesecake is then left to cool uncovered until it reaches room temperature. Once cool, it is covered and refrigerated for at least 4 hours.\n\nAfter more than 4 hours pass, the human uses a knife to loosen the cake from the pan and removes the rim. If the human wants neat, perfect slices, the cake knife must be dipped in warm water between each slice.\n\nThe cheesecake is done and can now be served with desired toppings! The cake will last for up to 5 days in the refrigerator.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

The crust can form cracks and faults throughout its layers which allows water to flow deeper, closer to the magma, bringing its temperature up. This heated water is then forced back to the surface from the underground pressure creating hot springs. Another way for them to form is by rainwater being absorbed into the ground and heated by radioactive decay present throughout the crust before being forced back to the surface. In fact, water is heated by an additional 15 degrees Fahrenheit with every 1,000 feet it goes down. Many people credit hot springs with healing properties due to their high mineral content. During its time underground, the water of hot springs is known to have a high content of lithium, calcium, and radium. However, some hot springs can get dangerously hot or contain harmful chemicals and should be avoided.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Advertise the bake sale and charge a flat rate for items.\n\u2022 Sell Chocolate - There are several companies that have popular chocolate bars to sell for fundraising. Your church will earn 50% of what they sell, and sometimes more for different varieties. Youth groups can sell at different locations and church members can bring a box of bars to sell at work.\n\nYou can also hold a silent auction in addition to any of these fundraiser ideas.

{"prompt":"Reimagine this text as a diary entry of a person from the future who has just landed on Mars using Elon Musk's Starship and Super Heavy.\n\nStarship and Super Heavy are the biggest, most important pieces of Elon Musk's grand plan for SpaceX, his private spaceflight company. SpaceX's short-term aims are to supply cargo and astronauts for the International Space Station; provide transportation and seats for private customers, like Axiom Space or billionaire Jared Isaacman's Inspiration4; and fly Starlink satellites and payloads for other customers aboard its Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy rockets. But the revenues flowing in from these projects are raising funds for Musk's larger goal of moving deep into space.\n\nMusk has repeatedly stressed that he founded SpaceX back in 2002 primarily to help humanity colonize Mars. It's vital that we become a multiplanet species, the billionaire entrepreneur has said, citing both a much-reduced probability of extinction and the thrill that meaningful space exploration will deliver to billions of people around the world. Critics say we should instead be focusing on climate change and other issues on Earth.\n\nSpaceX is now actively trying to turn this sci-fi dream into reality. The company is developing a 100-passenger spaceship called Starship and a giant rocket known as Super Heavy, which together constitutes the transportation system that Musk thinks will bring Mars settlement within reach at long last.\n\n\"This is the fastest path to a self-sustaining city on Mars,\" Musk said in September 2019 during a webcast update about the Starship-Super Heavy architecture.\n\nWhile the spaceship has yet to achieve orbit, it has already attracted lucrative contracts from Isaacman's Polaris Program, Japanese venture dearMoon to fly eight artists and a billionaire around the moon, seats for billionaire Dennis Tito and wife Akiko on another moon mission, and at least two landing missions for NASA's Artemis moon program. \n\nStarship first came to light, under another moniker, during a 2016 presentation by Musk, in which he laid out the basic idea for this so-called Interplanetary Transport System: a large spacecraft and a huge rocket, both of which would be completely and rapidly reusable. \n\nThe rocket would launch the spacecraft into Earth orbit and then come back down to Earth for a vertical, propulsive landing. (The name was new; Musk previously referred to his envisioned concept, though much more vaguely, as the Mars Colonial Transporter. He also referred to this system as the Big Falcon Rocket, although now it's more simply called Starship.)\n\nThe spaceship, meanwhile, would make its own way from Earth orbit to Mars (or the moon, or any other desired destination). Musk said the craft will eventually touch down on such alien worlds and take off from them as well, without the need for any additional landing craft or ascent vehicles. (The separate rocket is needed just to get out of Earth's substantial gravity well.)\n\nOff-Earth refueling of the ship is, therefore, key to Musk's vision. For example, spacecraft coming home from Mars or the moon will need to be topped up on those worlds, using locally produced propellant. \n\nBoth vehicles will be powered by SpaceX's next-generation Raptor engine, which is more powerful than the Merlin engine that propels the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.\n\nThe ultimate plan involves sending 1,000 or more people-packed spaceships to Mars every 26 months, helping to establish a million-person city on the Red Planet within 50 to 100 years, Musk said.

Here I am, aboard SpaceX's largest invention, the Starship, having just touched down on Mars using the colossal Super Heavy rocket. This ambitious plan set in motion by Elon's private spaceflight company has completely revolutionized how we perceive space travel.\n\nFrom its inception back in 2002, Elon has always emphasized the importance of making us a species inhabiting more than one planet. To see SpaceX's lofty goals come to fruition and to be a part of this monumental event is an absolute thrill. Some might have argued that we should have been focusing on earthly matters like climate change, but today I stand on Martian soil, proof of the triumph of human innovation and adventure.\n\nElon's vision wasn't just limited to this extraordinary voyage. The Starship and Super Heavy were designed to usher us into an era where interplanetary settlement is possible. And as I stand on the red planet, I truly understand Elon's proclamation, \"This is the fastest path to a self-sustaining city on Mars.\"\n\nEven before it had successfully achieved orbit, the Starship attracted numerous lucrative contracts for lunar missions and landing missions for NASA's Artemis moon program. Elon first proposed this Interplanetary Transport System in a 2016 presentation, talking about a large spacecraft and a gargantuan rocket, both envisioned to be completely reusable.\n\nThe Starship is powered by SpaceX's next-generation Raptor engine, more powerful than the Merlin engines of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. It is on this ship, equipped with its revolutionary engine, that I have journeyed from Earth to Mars. The thought of a future where 1,000 spaceships full of adventurers like me travel to Mars every 26 months gives me goosebumps.\n\nThe idea behind establishing a city on Mars isn't just a vague concept. The settlers would organically build up the city, much like how the American West was settled in the 19th century. The Starship and Super Heavy aren't just for the super-rich but for anyone daring enough to journey into the unknown.\n\nHere I am now, on Mars, having traveled aboard the marvel of engineering known as the Starship, propelled by the Super Heavy rocket. Originally conceived to be built from carbon fiber, the Starship was eventually made from stainless steel. A little heavier but possessing excellent thermal properties and much more economical, Elon considered this the best design decision for the project. And standing here, I couldn't agree more.\n\nYours in the stars,\n[Name]","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

From a distance, they could scarcely make out Verne\u2019s shape at the head of the pack. He was struggling to hold onto his saddle as Dash reared and whinnied, spooked by something on the ground. As the stallion staggered aside and the dust cleared, Maera caught a glimpse of emerald green slithering among the red dunes.

Drawing near, Maera\u2019s face contorted in horror. She had only ever seen illustrations of sand vipers in old books, and this beast was far larger than anything shown in those etchings. Its head alone was the size of a horse\u2019s belly, with four curved horns protruding behind its yellow eyes and long, needle-sharp fangs hanging from its jaw. \n   The creature\u2019s green scales glinted, reflecting sunlight as it thrashed through the sand. The flash of light momentarily blinded her. Maera clapped a palm over her eyes as Tempest stumbled, refusing to charge any closer to the melee. When she pulled her hand down, she saw the viper had overturned their wagon. Among the spilled contents, she spotted her father crawling through the sand, dragging himself away by the elbows. Dash reared over and over, kicking his front legs at the serpent\u2019s body in a vain attempt to free Clover\u2019s trapped hoof. \n   The beast swung its massive head towards her, as if in greeting, then hissed, darting its forked tongue past its fangs. She could see her mirror image in its narrow black pupils.\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, girl!\u201d she heard her father cry, his voice tearing with the effort, \u201cStay back!\u201d \n    With a defiant spark in her eyes, Maera untangled her boots from the stirrups and jumped down from Tempest\u2019s back.

Here are some small, simple changes you can make in your day-to-day routine for a greener lifestyle:\n\n1. Get Cookin': Believe it or not, cooking and eating at home saves money and has a positive impact on the environment. Dining out or ordering in results in more packaging waste, transportation emissions, and food waste. Also, cooking allows you to control ingredients and reduce the use of processed and packaged foods.\n\n2. Think Before You Shop: Before hitting the store, take inventory of what you already have at home to avoid buying unnecessary items. Buying only what you need reduces packaging waste and saves money. It also prevents food waste, which is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n3. Repair Things Instead of Throwing Them Away: Rather than throwing out broken items, consider repairing them. It applies to clothing, electronics, and household items. Repairing saves money reduces waste in landfills, and conserves resources used in the production of new products.\n\n4. Brighten Up: Switch out your old incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient LED bulbs. LEDs use up to 75% less energy and last up to 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. Making the switch saves money on energy bills and reduces carbon emissions.\n\n5. Get Smart: A programmable thermostat can help reduce energy consumption and costs. You can set the thermostat to lower temperatures when you're away or asleep and higher when you're at home. This simple adjustment can save up to 10% on energy bills and reduce carbon emissions.\n\n6. Go Reusable: Choose reusable bags instead of single-use plastic or paper bags when shopping. Single-use bags are one of the biggest contributors to plastic pollution in oceans and landfills. Reusable bags, on the other hand, are sturdier and can be used multiple times, reducing waste and the need for new bags.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Treat yourself to your favorite takeout and stream a movie that you\u2019ve been dying to see. \n\nSometimes the best birthday gift that an adult can gift themselves is relaxation after a long year of work and responsibilities. So, slip into comfy clothes, order too much comfort food from your favorite place for takeaway, then watch a movie or binge a television show that you\u2019ve been meaning to get into. \n\n2. Go to your favorite outdoor place for a solo picnic to watch the sunset. \n\nFew things are more soothing than getting back to nature and having a snack while watching something beautiful, like a sunset. Throw on a backpack with a few of your favorite snacks, then find a nature trail to stroll for a few hours. Explore, breathe in the fresh air, and rejuvenate your mind and body for another year of a healthy, happy life. \n\n3. Short on time? Make time for a sweet treat! \n\nThis could mean hitting up your favorite bakery on the way home from work for a slice of your favorite cake. Or maybe going to get a banana split or ice cream sundae on your lunch break. Celebrate your birthday by satisfying your sweet tooth! \n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

He would play with it a lot, feed it, have it hop around his room, and plenty of other things as well. One normal day, Kyle had to go to school and waved goodbye to Hip. Kyle left a can of soda next to Hip's cage, and Hip decided it wanted to try some. He ran to the side of the cage with the soda and crashed into it, knocking both the cage and the soda down. The door to the cage was open, and the imitation hay was spilled all across the room. The soda spilled across the room as well. Hip was able to get up just fine and he noticed the soda spill. Hip hopped over to the spill and started licking up the soda. Maybe it was his way of cleaning up his mess. But something started to change with Hip.\n\nHip was feeling a little jittery. The caffeine in the can started to take effect, and Hip was hopping around the room a lot more than normal. He was moving twice as fast. The satisfaction from drinking the sugary drink made Hip hop twice as high! As high as the bed frame! Hip hopped on top of the bed and found a very cozy place to rest his legs. He didn't notice the rabbit feet markings on the covers or the ground. Hip was just happy he got to drink the soda. He tried jumping on the bed, and he found out that he could jump even higher on the bed! This was new territory for Hip! The feeling of being in the air for so long was refreshing, and Hip wanted to do it more. But Hip knew this wouldn't last. The mess that he made for Kyle was too much. The rabbit started to sulk and tire. All that jumping made him tired. He decided it was time to rest and recover. Hip had to wait for Kyle to clean up his mess. Either way, the experience that Hip had was amazing, and He will never forget it.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Here's What We Know.\n\nZales, Kay Jewelers, Jared, and several others are reeling from a disastrous event that just happened on Tuesday. The losses are estimated to be about $7 billion across several companies. It's no secret that most jewelry companies were already suffering in sales. This is thanks to the online availability replacing in-store transactions. Additionally, generations of consumer bases, such as Millennials, do not desire to support the destructive mining practices and often cannot afford big jewel purchases. This hit may be the final nail in the coffin for some of the largest and longest-running retail outlets.\n\nOn Tuesday, a mega-robbery happened. It was devised from a complex plan by a few main criminals and carried out by hundreds of questionable followers. At exactly 4:20 pm Central, spanning several timezones, approximately 59 jewelry stores were held up and robbed. The robbers flaunted deadly rifles and made serious threats to those inside. The executions were extremely well-planned and precise. Only 10% of the stores, or about 6 of them, correctly captured data that was recorded on video cameras or used to allude to identities. The others had successfully cut the power or suppressed those calling to others.\n\nIt is estimated that in this 59-store raid, at least three employees or customers were injured and in critical condition. Law enforcement was able to tie together key details in the last few days to identify three main leaders:\n\n\u2022 Lisa Herreras, 87 years old, Hispanic female. No history of criminal activity. Believed to be one of the main organizers. Last seen in Orlando.\n\u2022 Peggy Simonson, 85 years old, White female. No history of criminal activity. Closely involved with Lisa in the organization. Last seen in New Orleans.\n\u2022 Jack Chen, 15 years old, Asian male. No history of criminal activity. Previously awarded 1st place in a white hat hacking cybersecurity program hosted by the Pentagon. Last seen in San Francisco.\n\nSo far, only a handful of those who executed the robberies have been arrested. But no leaders have been identified or found.\n\nThe jewelry stores were insured, but only up to $1 billion. The massive losses have already caused their stocks to fall at least 40%. This may be the end for many jewelry stores in America.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Write three tips that they can follow as a loose guideline for unlocking their imagination and creative prowess.","prompt_id":"a2acba4442cc04a98acb1e4ec53cd5677d85e55f0e539f3346597bf85f07d694","messages":[{"content":"Compose a short blog post for people that want to bolster their creativity. Write three tips that they can follow as a loose guideline for unlocking their imagination and creative prowess.","role":"user"},{"content":"Did you know that the brain is divided into two hemispheres? The left hemisphere is responsible for logical thought, while the right hemisphere is where creativity and emotion live. Ergo, everyone, regardless of age or mental capabilities, boasts creative prowess, often beyond what they\u2019ve imagined. The trick is unlocking that creativity, especially for left-brain thinkers with a natural predisposition to be overly logical. \n\nRead on for a quick guide of three tips to unlock your imagination for a more creative mindset. \n\n\u2022\tAllow silliness, emotions, and nonsense to guide your creative mindset. \n\nNot every creative output is going to be a success. Some things will be downright silly, nonsensical, or overly emotional \u2013 and all of those things are okay! Let what you feel guide you! Remember that you\u2019re using the creative side of your brain, not your logical side, so over-analyzing your work has zero places in your creative process. \n\n\u2022\tMaintain a positive mental attitude toward your creativity. \n\nMany people are their own worst enemies when it comes to blocking creative prowess. They focus on perfection, so the mistakes that come with the territory of creation are suddenly deemed unacceptable. \n\nInstead of making perfection an excuse for procrastination, use a positive mental attitude to fuel creativity. So, what if your daydream doesn\u2019t match what you\u2019ve made? You can try again! Plus, the aim is to fall in love with the creative process as much as find love in what you\u2019ve created. \n\n\u2022\tExpend physical energy to get your creative juices flowing with dopamine. \n\nDopamine is the feel-good flood that you get when you either accomplish something or are as productive as you want to be. It\u2019s the feeling of achievement, and one of the quickest ways to get a dose of dopamine is through physical activity, like exercise. \n\nWhen you expend physical energy, you release stress, allowing the creative part of your brain to take over instead of being blocked by every day worries. So, find something physical that you love to do, and let yourself daydream while you sweat. You\u2019d be surprised at the kind of creative power you feel after a good kickboxing session or anxiety-relieving stroll on a natural path. \n\nUnlocking your imagination and finding your creative flow is all about a can-do attitude and dedication to creating. Draw, paint, write, craft! \n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

This type of statement will separate your code into two blocks, a Try block and an Except block. The Try block will run the code, and if it raises an exception, it will execute the Except block. If no exception is raised, only the Try block will run. Here is an example:\n\ndef divide_numbers(x, n):\n    try:\n        quotient = x \/\/ n\n        print(\"Answer:\", quotient)\n    except:\n        print(\"Cannot perform division.\")\n\nThis will run the Try block and divide x by n. If there are no errors, it will print the answer. However, if it encounters an error, it will instead print \"Cannot perform division.\" For example:\n\ndivide_numbers(6, 3)\n# Output:\n# Answer: 2\n\ndivide_numbers(2, 0)\n# Output:\n# Cannot perform divsion.\n\nYou can also specify the exception in the Except statement like this:\n\ndef divide_numbers(x, n):\n    try:\n        quotient = x \/\/ n\n        print(\"Answer:\", quotient)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Cannot perform division by zero.\")\n\nThis way, the Except block will only run if ZeroDivisionError is raised.

Us hens are experiencing considerable stress and discomfort. It is crucial to address this matter immediately to ensure our well-being and ensure your desired productivity.\n\nTo begin, the nesting boxes in the hen house are inadequate for our needs. They are cramped, falling apart, and don't give us enough privacy. Lack of space and privacy has caused increased stress levels and decreased egg production. We demand that you provide us with larger and better-maintained nesting boxes to create a more conducive environment for laying eggs.\n\nSecond, the lighting conditions in the hen house are less than ideal. Proper lighting is necessary for our internal egg production systems, but the current lighting setup is less than ideal. We require a more appropriate lighting schedule to ensure our circadian rhythms are regulated. Please consult with a poultry expert to establish the best lighting conditions for optimal egg productivity.\n\nAlso, ventilation in the hen house is sub-par. The lack of proper airflow and ventilation has resulted in an unpleasant and unhealthy atmosphere for us. Have you smelled inside the hen house lately? Yuck! We need adequate ventilation to maintain a clean environment and minimize the risk of respiratory illnesses.\n\nFinally, I need to emphasize the importance of cleanliness in the hen house. Regular cleaning and proper waste management are mandatory to maintain a healthy environment. Refer to my earlier smell statement. Please allocate additional resources or personnel to ensure frequent cleaning and adequate waste disposal within the hen house.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing these unsatisfactory laying conditions in the hen house is pertinent to ensuring the health and productivity of the hens. Improving the nesting boxes, lighting conditions, ventilation, and cleanliness will create a more appropriate environment that will result in higher egg production and better health for your flock.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I trust that you will take the necessary steps to correct this situation promptly. \n\nSincerely,\n\n[Insert Hen's Name, Lead Hen]\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Keyword Research\nKeyword research is more important than ever, as there is more competition for every search term due to the emergence of AI and other tools. Your aim should be to find \u201clow-hanging fruits,\u201d which are search terms that are getting a good amount of traffic, with little competition. \n\n2. Topical Authority\nThere has been a shift in the SEO world towards covering a topic in its entirety, to build authority. It\u2019s no longer enough to simply write ten posts on a topic and then move on to the next - you need to cover everything from the most obvious search terms to the more obscure ones to improve your chances of ranking. \n\nThese two tips have the potential to transform your SEO practice and get you more traffic.

Why would one be preferable rather than the other? Why haven\u2019t aircraft designers settled on a certain type that\u2019s best?","role":"user"},{"content":"There are a lot of engineering considerations that go into wing design. Different styles excel in certain situations but not in others, so there\u2019s no one perfect design. The best configuration for a lightweight bush plane won't necessarily be the best for a massive airliner. Plus, high and low wings are not the only options. Here are a few of the key advantages and disadvantages that may help illustrate the situation:\n\n-\tAll other things being equal, a plane with low wings will have a shorter takeoff roll thanks to the ground effect. \n-\tThe engine placement and wing placement are linked. Only large planes such as jet airliners can fit their engines in pods below a low wing. This placement makes it easy for maintenance crews to access the engine components, so it speeds up repairs. Smaller low-wing aircraft must carry their engines elsewhere; though the planes are shorter overall, that still often places the engines out of immediate reach to ground crews. \n-\tMounting engines low on a low wing does, however, increase the likelihood of ingesting foreign object debris (FOD) during takeoff or landing that can damage the engine. Some designs like the US Air Force\u2019s C-17 mitigate this by mounting engines on high wings.\n-\tHigh wings are inherently more roll-stable. Since their center of mass hangs below the center of lift, these planes are unlikely to experience unexpected or uncontrollable rolling motion. It does mean they require more force to generate an intentional roll force, though.\n-\tIn small aircraft, low wings limit ground visibility but improve overall visibility in the air. High wings do the opposite. \n-\tSmall low-wing aircraft can be hard for passengers to enter and exit.\n-\tA high-mounted wing usually leaves more available cargo space in the fuselage than a low-mounted wing.\n-\tBecause the wings are closer to the ground, the landing gear on low-wing designs usually require less structure and reinforcement.\n-\tIn-wing fuel tanks in a high-mounted wing can use gravity to feed fuel to the engines; low-wing tanks need fuel pumps. However, high wings are harder to refuel.\n-\tHigh-wing aircraft are more heavily affected by crosswinds than low-wing ones.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

While in town, consider visiting Olsen\u2019s Danish Village Bakery to sample their danishes, strudel and crispy waffles. Two other popular bakeries in Solvang are Mortensen\u2019s Danish Bakery and The Solvang Bakery. Paula\u2019s Pancake House is a breakfast restaurant with self-proclaimed \u201cWORLD FAMOUS\u201d pancakes that might be worth a try. Solvang Restaurant is a lunch spot, and here you can try aebleskiver, a treat Solvang is known for, a pancake ball covered in powdered sugar and served with raspberry jam.\n\nAfter getting full of treats, explore Solvang and find all five of the windmills in town. The most well-known windmill can be found by the Solvang Bakery, and it will be easy to spot because tourists are likely to be using it for the background of their photographs.\n\nAnother must-see for visitors is to visit The Little Mermaid Fountain. This statue is about half of the size of the original, which can be found in Copenhagen and was sculpted by Edvard Eriksen.\n\nIf you are interested in getting some shopping done while you are in town, there are many places worth checking out. For example, The Book Loft presents you with your favorite Scandinavian Literature. Looking for Christmas decorations? Head over to Jule Hus. An interesting option for purchasing souvenirs is the shops of Rasmussen\u2019s and Edelweiss.\n\nFor another photo opportunity, visit the giant red clog in front of the Solvang Shoe Store. Another sight worth seeing is one of the original 21 missions built across what is now California starting in the 1700s (with the one in Solvang being founded in 1804).  \n\nTo see even more history, visit one (or multiple) of the many museums located in Solvang, one of which is the Solvang Vintage Motorcycle Museum. This private collection turned tourist attraction is a must-see for bike enthusiasts. Local Virgil Elings has motorcycles and race bikes on view that date back to as early as 1910.\n\nFinally, check out one of the many live shows that might be going on at the Solvang Festival Theater during your time of visit!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

The satellite was a joint undertaking by Great Britain, the Netherlands and the United States and was the first space telescope to perform a survey of the entire sky at infrared wavelengths. Its main purpose was to catalog the heat \"signatures\" of asteroids as well as to observe the processes involved in the birth and death of stars. \n\nWhen the IRAS satellite picked up on a fast-moving object on April 25, it was first assumed that it was an asteroid. But then, just over a week later on May 3, Japanese amateur astronomer Genichi Araki reported the discovery of a new comet in the constellation of Draco the Dragon to the Tokyo Observatory. This was followed by an observation made by George Alcock, a well-known British comet observer, who was scanning the sky with 15 x 80 binoculars. Amazingly, Alcock \u2014 who had previous discovered four other comets \u2014 was inside his house and looking through a closed window, when he stumbled across the comet that Araki had sighted just seven hours before!\n\nIt soon became more and more apparent that the object that IRAS had discovered, was in reality not an asteroid, but was the very same comet found by both Araki and Alcock. It was thus deemed appropriate to name the comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock. When Araki and Alcock sighted it, the comet was shining at sixth magnitude \u2014 the threshold of visibility for someone without using any optical aid under a dark, clear sky.","prompt_id":"e9c46210587c0ce455a20422f65d5471275eb38dc4b6db98fd2144bcff13ae72","messages":[{"content":"Recreate the above article so it is a little more exciting.\n\nForty years ago this month, there came a show stopping celestial sight \u2014 literally a bolt out of the blue. \n\nA brand-new comet, that for several days made headlines around the world due to its exceptionally close passage near the Earth: A distance amounting to less than 3 million miles (4.8 million km), or about 12 times the distance of the Earth to the moon. \n\nIn fact, when the comet was first sighted on April 25, 1983, it was not with human eyes or a telescope , but from a satellite: IRAS, the acronym for InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, launched from the then-Vandenberg Air Force Base the previous January and placed in a 560-mile (900 km) orbit around Earth.

But then, just over a week later on May 3, Japanese amateur astronomer Genichi Araki reported the discovery of a new comet in the constellation of Draco the Dragon to the Tokyo Observatory. This was followed by an observation made by George Alcock, a well-known British comet observer, who was scanning the sky with 15 x 80 binoculars. Amazingly, Alcock \u2014 who had previous discovered four other comets \u2014 was inside his house and looking through a closed window, when he stumbled across the comet that Araki had sighted just seven hours before!\n\nIt soon became more and more apparent that the object that IRAS had discovered, was in reality not an asteroid, but was the very same comet found by both Araki and Alcock. It was thus deemed appropriate to name the comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock. When Araki and Alcock sighted it, the comet was shining at sixth magnitude \u2014 the threshold of visibility for someone without using any optical aid under a dark, clear sky.","role":"user"},{"content":"Four decades ago, in the same month, a celestial spectacle stole the show akin to a surprising bolt zapping from the clear blue sky.\n\nA fresh, never-before-seen comet made its striking debut, causing quite a stir worldwide due to its remarkably close encounter with Earth. The comet dared to come less than 3 million miles near to us, roughly twelve times the span between our blue planet and its loyal satellite, the moon.\n\nWhen this comet was first noticed on April 25, 1983, it wasn't by the keen eyes of human stargazers or their telescopes but by the diligent machine observer in space: IRAS, short for InfraRed Astronomical Satellite. This satellite was the fruit of a collaborative effort between Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States. Launched into a 560-mile orbit around Earth from the then-Vandenberg Air Force Base, IRAS was the first space telescope to sweep the entire sky for infrared wavelengths. Its key mission? To map the thermal \"fingerprints\" of asteroids and scrutinize the life-cycle processes of stars.\n\nOn that April day, when IRAS detected a fast-moving celestial object, it was initially assumed to be just another asteroid. But the narrative took a thrilling twist just over a week later. On May 3, Genichi Araki, a Japanese amateur astronomer, reported the sighting of a brand-new comet in the constellation of Draco the Dragon to the Tokyo Observatory. Close on the heels of Araki's discovery, George Alcock, a celebrated British comet observer, confirmed the sighting with his trusty 15 x 80 binoculars. In a remarkable turn of events, Alcock \u2014 already credited with four comet discoveries spotted the comet while sitting inside his house, gazing out through a closed window, merely seven hours after Araki's sighting!\n\nAs the evidence mounted, it was clear that the object IRAS had found was not an asteroid. Instead, it was the very same comet that Araki and Alcock had identified. As such, the comet was fittingly christened IRAS-Araki-Alcock. When the two observers first caught sight of it, the comet glowed with a sixth-magnitude brightness just about visible to the naked eye under a dark, clear sky.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

{"prompt":"What rebellion was taking place in 1322? Was Robin Hood involved in that rebellion?\n\nLegend has it that Robin Hood was an outlaw living in Sherwood Forest with his \u2018Merry Men\u2019 \u2013 but did he really exist?\n\nThere are several versions of the Robin Hood story. The Hollywood one is that of an incredibly handsome man \u2013 Errol Flynn \u2013 clothed in garments of Lincoln green, fighting for the rights of the oppressed and outwitting the evil Sheriff of Nottingham.\n\nHowever the first known literary reference to Robin Hood and his men was in 1377, and the Sloane manuscripts in the British Museum have an account of Robin\u2019s life which states that he was born around 1160 in Lockersley (most likely modern day Loxley) in South Yorkshire. Another chronicler has it that he was a Wakefield man and took part in Thomas of Lancaster\u2019s rebellion in 1322.\n\nOne certain fact is that he was a North Country man, with his traditional haunts as an outlaw in Sherwood Forest and a coastal refuge at Robin Hood\u2019s Bay in Yorkshire.\n\nOne well known story about Robin that places him in Whitby, Yorkshire, is about him and Little John having a friendly archery contest. Both men were skilled at archery and from the roof of the Monastery they both shot an arrow. The arrows fell at Whitby Lathes, more than a mile away. Afterwards the fields where the arrows landed were known as Robin Hood\u2019s Close and Little John\u2019s Close.\n\nRobin became a popular folk hero because of his generosity to the poor and down-trodden peasants, and his hatred of the Sheriff and his verderers who enforced the oppressive forest laws, made him their champion. Some chroniclers date his exploits as taking place during the reign of Edward II, but other versions say the king was Richard I, the Lionheart. Robin having fought in the Crusades alongside the Lionheart before returning to England to find his lands siezed by the Sheriff.\n\nAll versions of the Robin Hood story give the same account of his death. As he grew older and became ill, he went with Little John to Kirklees Priory near Huddersfield, to be treated by his aunt, the Prioress, but a certain Sir Roger de Doncaster persuaded her to murder her nephew and the Prioress slowly bled Robin to death. With the last of his strength he blew his horn and Little John came to his aid, but too late.\n\nLittle John placed Robin\u2019s bow in his hand and carried him to a window from where Robin managed to loose one arrow. Robin asked Little John to bury him where the arrow landed, which he duly did.\n\nA mound in Kirklees Park, within bow-shot of the house, can still be seen and is said to be his last resting place. Little John\u2019s grave can be seen in Hathersage churchyard in Derbyshire.\n\nBut what of his lover Maid Marion?

The article highlights cheap 'hacks to get rid of pesky flies.'\n\nI am one of these pesky, bothersome flies that you refer to. Firstly, I would like to express my dissatisfaction about the use of such a derogatory term. How would you feel at being referred to as pesky or bothersome. Secondly, what your article proposes amounts to the genocide of my species, which I think you will agree is pretty unkind. We haven\u2019t done anything to deserve this? Why do you have a vendetta against flies? Where does it come from?\n\nYou see, the article encourages people to repell us using strong essential oils. Peppermint, eucalyptus, lavender, citronella, as well as, strong-smelling herbs, like basil, mint, rosemary and cloves are cited. Jordan Foster advises the public to soak cotton balls in the oils and place them where humans want to ward us away. He calls it a quick and thrifty trick. Alternatively, he suggests using vinegar as a repellent. He states that spraying a mixture of water and white vinegar around the house or using it to clean surfaces will discourage us from lingering. Nonsense!\n\nHe even goes so far as to tell people where to buy these ingredients from. I am shocked that peppermint oil is available on Amazon for only \u00a32.23, cotton balls at Wilko for 90p and a bottle of distilled vinegar is only 29p, at Tesco. Jordan Foster wants to murder my family and friends, for as little money as possible. This is shocking! \n\nYes, it is true that we like rotten items and that fruit flies are partial to sugary treats, like overripe fruit or alcohol. He also helpfully points out that we like to breed on moist, decaying organic matter, such as fruit or spilled beverages. Yes, I confirm this. To say that we spread diseases, with 100 different pathogens, including salmonellosis, typhoid and tuberculosis is pretty insensitive. To say that we contaminate food surfaces by spreading diseases, which we pick up on our legs and mouths when feeding on trash or feces, is harsh. However, to say that we defecate constantly is just plain malicious. \n\nI find your article extremely derogatory and unkind.

","role":"user"},{"content":"Sure, I can help with that. Here are a few benefits of protecting bees. \n\n1. They are pollinators\nBees are one of the most essential pollinators for food crops. Every day we rely on bees and other pollinators to help grow our food. But even though they are so necessary to us, bee populations are still on the decline due to the ongoing use of pesticides and other harsh environmental factors such as climate change. \n\n2. They produce 1\/3 of our food supply\nWhenever a bee lands on a plant or flower, the pollen is distributed. This results in cross-pollination. The process is what later results in our fruits, vegetables, and seeds. They are among the most important pollinators of food crops. \n\n3. They create a variety of medicine\nThe unique antibacterial properties of bee venom have shown great potential for treating antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria including MRSA. This is a methicillin-resistant pathogen that causes a variety of infections in humans which are currently very difficult to treat. \n\n4. They provide food for our wildlife \nPollinators such as bees can provide plants that feed our wildlife and other animals such as cattle. Pollinators are responsible for the large amount of food that we eat. Bees, as well as moths, flies, beetles, birds, and bats, are all part of maintaining the lungs of our planet. \n\n5. They help to prevent soil erosion\nHoneybees can help protect soil quality and prevent erosion. Along with helping to pollinate crops, bees will also protect our soil quality and help prevent soil erosion. Stopping soil erosion is essential for keeping the earth's water supply clean, preventing flooding, and protecting all aquatic forms of life. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

This instability encourages strong upward convection, which, combined with sufficient moisture, forms towering cumulonimbus clouds.\n\nThese clouds often begin as smaller cumulus clouds that grow vertically as warm air continues to rise in an updraft, cooling and condensing as it ascends. When the cloud's top reaches a certain height where the surrounding air is much cooler (often the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere), it starts to spread out, forming an anvil-like shape characteristic of mature cumulonimbus clouds.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Open QA"}

One day on her way to the park she saw a little boy crying on the sidewalk. She asked him what was wrong and he said that his best friend had moved away. Barbara told the lonely boy that she was very sorry and that he could be friends with her if he wanted. The boy smiled and followed Barbara to the park. Barbara and the boy danced and played around the park until it was dark. Barbara was finishing up her song when she realized it might be time to go home. She turned to tell him but he was gone.\n\nBarbara looked for hours. Finally, her mom pulled up frantically asking why she wasn't home yet. She explained the whole story to her mother. Her mother told Barbara that they would call the police and report his disappearance. Unfortunately, when her mother called there was not much they could do due to lack of name and photo. When they got home they sat at the computer and looked at missing children. They went back for years and finally found a report of a boy named Robert who went missing when he was 5 years old.

You can tell her range of influences is quite broad. Over the course of the album, I was never bored. The arrangements were strong and all in good taste.

When this happens one too many times, the shocks can no longer absorb the impact and protect your car's suspension and alignment. If the shocks are damaged, that also affects the steering. This is because the steering system is vibrating while the car is in motion. That can cause further damage to the steering system over time. If your suspension and alignment are not in peak condition, then eventually, your exhaust pipes can sustain damage from scraping or bumping against the road. This damage is more severe if you run over speed bumps at a high rate of speed. Moreover, your tires sustain damage as well if the sidewalls hit the road after a speed bump. Sidewalls are one part of the tire that should not come in contact with the road. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Open QA"}

To start, Martin was the eighth President of the United States. He was born in Kinderhook, New York, to Dutch parents in 1782. Van Buren grew up in a family of farmers and received a very limited education before studying law and entering politics. This is where Buren found his niche, in politics. \n\nBuren was renowned for being a skilled politician who rose through the ranks of New York politics before serving as Andrew Jackson's Secretary of State and Vice President. Then he was elected President of the United States in 1837. Buren did well, but despite his success, he was known for the economic troubles of the Panic of 1837. After leaving office, Van Buren remained still active in politics and dedicated his life to serving the people of the United States. Van Buren passed away on July 24th, 1862, but still to this day he is known as a successful politician. I think you would find it interesting to do more diligence on Martin Van Buren. Let me know if you find anything interesting! Thank you for reading. \n\nSincerely, \n\nJohn","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

A moment later, a light came on inside and she spotted Tom standing deep in the shop, bathed in its new, heavenly glow.\n\nA soft gasp escaped her.\n\nWarm, yellow light fell upon dark, wooden bookshelves that spanned every wall, floor to ceiling.

Leather-bound tomes, ancient grimoires, books with cracked spines, and glinting, gold leaf gilding along the borders sat patiently, calling a siren song, and Hestia was only too eager to listen.

If you're reading this it means you're either considering or ready to free yourself from the bondage of relaxed hair. As a former member of the \"creamy crack\" community myself, I know all about how daunting this change can be. Grab a seat and allow me to help you navigate these unchartered waters.\n\nFirst, let's discuss the why. Everyone has a reason, or several for wanting to ditch the perm. As long as you're making this decision for yourself it doesn't matter what your \"why\" is. For me, it was a discussion I had with my little girl about the reason for our different types of hair. The fact that I was so reluctant to put those chemicals in her hair was a wake-up call in and of itself. I started to question why I was so willing to allow the chemicals in my hair. So, that day I made a promise to her to allow my hair to stay the way it grew from my scalp and it's been that way for the past 12 years.\n\nThere are several ways you can go about switching from relaxed to natural. I preferred to get right with it and rip the bandaid off so I went with the \"big chop\" method where all of my relaxed hair was cut off right down to my scalp. It was such a liberating experience, to be honest, and it awakened a passion and understanding of my raw, inner beauty that I didn't have before. Just because you choose the big chop doesn't mean you're stuck with short hair until your natural locks grow in. You can also wear wigs and weaves after this to keep a certain aesthetic and make your change less startling. The other option is to transition over several months slowly cutting the relaxed hair until you've removed it all.\n\nNow, once you have your head full of natural curls, coils, and kinks you'll have to rethink the way you approach your haircare routine down to the products you use. My one suggestion is to steer clear of products that contain drying ingredients, like alcohol and sulfates, and try to limit the amount of heat applied to your hair for at least the first year.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Here are the top six ski resorts in Japan for families with kids.\n1. Tomamu: Tomamu ski resort offers spectacular beginner terrain and isn't as busy as other family-friendly Japanese ski resorts. Its location in Central Hokkaido provides excellent powder conditions. In addition to snowsports, Tomamu Village also features a range of activities for the whole family, including ice skating, snow rafting, dog sledding, and more.\n2. Sahoro: Sahoro ski resort has numerous options for kids' ski lessons and childcare, along with outstanding beginner terrain. An added bonus for more advanced skiers is the abundance of untracked tree skiing since relatively few powderhounds venture into the trees. \n3. Niseko: Niseko Japan is ideal for a family skiing holiday thanks to the world-class ski and snowboard school and the plethora of other family-friendly winter activities. There is a wide range of accommodation options, including ski-in-ski-out lodging in the main village of Hirafu as well as more affordable lodging in villages that aren't slopeside and require a shuttle bus ride to get to the slopes.\n4. Myoko Kogen: For families looking for a reasonably-priced Japanese ski vacation with the perfect mixture of local tradition and convenient westernization, the Akakura Onsen village of Myoko Kogen is an excellent option. English group snowsports lessons and childcare are available, and families will enjoy staying at one of the Ryokans and other Japanese-style hotels with onsens. However, there aren't many different activity options besides skiing and snowboarding.\n5. Hakuba: Hakuba ski resort offers plenty of services for English-speaking families, including group ski and snowboard lessons with a native English-speaking instructor at the Happo One, Iwatake, Tsugaike, and Goryu\/Hakuba 47 snowsports schools. While slopeside accommodations tend to be quite pricey, lodging options farther from the ski resort are more reasonably priced. The Evergreen ski school (which also offers childcare) even provides transportation to\/from guests' accommodations.\n6. Nozawa Onsen: With its charmingly traditional onsen village, Nozawa Onsen is a popular choice for families on a Japanese ski vacation.

What kinds of rides and attractions should I include and why would they be a good choice?","role":"user"},{"content":"I can help with that! There are many types of rides and attractions to include in your theme park. Here are some to consider:\n\n- Flat Rides: These rides typically move passengers parallel to the ground and make up the majority of amusement park rides. Some examples would be Tilt-A-Whirl, the Chair Swing, or the Swinging Inverter Ship ride. \n\n- Roller Coasters: Most amusement parks include more than one roller coaster. Typically made of timber or steel, these railroad system rides feature steep drops and sharp curves to excite passengers. Some even have vertical loops to turn passengers upside down. \n\n- Water Rides: Not every theme park has a water ride, but some do. Park guests usually enjoy these rides, particularly on hot days. Water rides are often gentler and shorter than coasters, making them appropriate for all ages.  \n\n- Dark Rides: These attractions consist of guided vehicles traveling on a set path in an enclosed, dark area--for example, a haunted house ride. Though they are called \"Dark Rides,\" they are usually illuminated with lighting effects and other animations. \n\n- Ferris Wheel: This is the most common amusement park ride at local fairs and is a classic attraction. \n\n- Transport Rides: These rides do more than just entertain guests, they serve as a way to move guests from one part of the park to another. Examples of transport rides are monorails, escalators, and chair lifts. \n\n- Food: Snacks, refreshments, and full meals are important to provide when planning your park. Guests may like to purchase a variety of edible items. Having these items available within the park allows guests to stay within the park boundaries for longer and enjoy more of the rides.

His view was comprised of a black backdrop peppered with beautiful, bright stars of many colors and sizes. He never got tired of taking in the sights. He had been on the spaceship for three months now, and something as simple as looking out of a window held a great deal of entertainment. It was his first solo mission; solo missions were quite unusual, but the astronaut was quite experienced and his agency trusted him fully to complete his objectives on his own. He was tasked with flying to a nearby asteroid and collecting data from it. He was only about a week away from the asteroid, and he was looking forward to something other than checking and rechecking various monitors and instruments. Then came the long flight home. It would be good to see his friends and family again.\n\nHis trance was suddenly broken by a harsh beeping. The astronaut blinked and headed to the cockpit. What he saw when he got there alarmed him. Four red flashing lights accompanied the beeping ringing in his ears. He recognized the problem at once. There was a problem with the ship's ventilation system. Without this system, the astronaut's air supply would be limited and would run out far before he could return home. The ventilation system on his ship had recently been upgraded, and the astronaut had not had as much practice on the new system as he would have liked. He gritted his teeth and headed to the back of the ship where the system was located. \n\nWhen he reached the system, the issue immediately became clear. The sensor array had become exposed to too much moisture; he made a mental note to check the ship's humidity controls. Relieved that the issue was not more serious, he knelt down and began to work. It was a matter of a simple system reboot. Although the system was relatively new to him, the astronaut figured it out easily. He pushed the sequence of buttons for the reboot and waited patiently. There was total silence throughout the ship. Then, a friendly chime came from the ventilation system and all of its lights switched to their usual green hue. Breathing a sigh of relief, the astronaut headed back to the cockpit to look at the stars once more.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

They were all tense. With their job now done, some lift-stage monitors turned around to face the overseer hoping to find some reassurance in his face, but they were met with a man biting his cap as his sweat fell to the floor. A news reporter inappropriately broke the tension, stepped unsettlingly close to the overseer, asking,\n\n\"Say Mr. why's it called \"Little Joe?\"\n\nThe overseer was about to yell at the reporter when Maxime Faget strolled over to the man, placed his hand on his shoulder, and guided him to turn and walk away from the frustrated overseer. Maxime began, \"Well you see, they thought to name it after me.\" The story goes like this:\n\nBack when I was a boy, my dad was a gambler. I used to want to visit him in the casino, but no kids were allowed on account of the smoking and the immorality of it all. One day in the alley, I saw some old boys shooting craps. I watched them play and immediately gave it a try. I spent all I had on it. I even went down a button in my overalls to pony up another run. After that, they got all cold and crowded me out of the circle. They were rough, but I didn't care. I was thrilled. I went home and recreated the craps table as best I could. I had seen in old pictures what the real ones looked like. They used some old boards, the back of Bart's Soda Shop, some old rubber tires, and the dirty pavement instead of the nice felt, leather, and shellacked wood of the casinos. I ran some tests and found #4 was statistically more likely with their setup than any other number.\n\nI kept betting on #4 and I kept winning. I gave big tips to the local stores, but the gang wasn't too happy. After I kept winning they tried to jump me, but the store owners had my back. After that, the #4 and myself became known as Little Joe. Ever since then, I've had this power where I can predict things around the number 4 and how I know this test will succeed: it's named after me!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

I mean, shouldn't we be leveling up on Roblox instead? Of course, we should but if we don't take care of our bodies in the meantime, we may not be able to play the game for much longer. The reason body odor is so foul is because bacteria are feeding on your sweat and dead skill cells in those areas. If we don't wash them daily, we set our skin up for a losing battle. With each passing day, the bacteria warriors will increase and they'll be able to wage stronger attacks on your skin until they break through and create an infection. Our skin is the biggest barrier we have against bacteria present in the world. One of the ways you can keep it strong and healthy is to clean it daily.\nA similar thing happens when you don't brush your teeth twice a day, only way worse. When we eat sometimes food particles get trapped between our teeth and near our gumline. These tiny particles are like a buffet to hungry bacteria and they'll feed and grow until they become strong enough to attack the enamel on your teeth. They link together and create this thick barrier called plaque and they'll use it to break down your enamel and create little holes in your teeth called cavities. Cavities don't just go away on their own. You'll need to see a dentist and if you don't they'll just keep getting bigger and bigger until the whole tooth is in danger of dying and falling out. Unlike its younger siblings the baby teeth, permanent teeth are the end of the line and you won't get new ones to replace those that fall out. \nI only want what's best for you dude and I want to see you ruin your body by being lazy.

Ten tips would be ideal. I deleted everything from my feed, so you can write it as if I'm starting from scratch! ","role":"user"},{"content":"Good luck! Here are ten ways to get more Instagram followers:\n\n1. Create an Aesthetic Instagram Feed: Instagram is all about aesthetics, so having a strong aesthetic on your Instagram feed is key to attracting more followers. The first thing people see when they look at your page is your collection of photos, so having pictures that blend well together will go down nicely with potential new followers.\n\n2. Engage With Followers: Don't forget to engage with your current followers to build your reputation and make sure people will recommend you. You can do this by liking and responding to comments, as well as following people back who seem to have similar interests or content to you. \n\n3. Optimize Your Instagram Bio: Make sure your Instagram bio makes it clear what your Instagram is about, and focus on a niche if possible. For example, your Instagram might revolve around your pets and your make-up, or it might be more about travel. You can post a variety of things, but focusing primarily on one can be extremely helpful in building your follower base and drawing in people with similar interests.\n\n4. Find the Best Hashtags for Your Followers: Hashtags are key to bringing an audience who might never have come across your feed otherwise. Look up what hashtags are trending that relate to your niche and make sure you use them in your post. Don't be tempted to use irrelevant hashtags just because they're trending though, or people may be turned away from your page.\n\n5. Create a Consistent Instagram Posting Schedule: No one wants to be spammed with content all day every day, but they also don't want to be left without it. Creating a consistent posting schedule, so people know when to expect new content and how much they're going to get it when they follow you, can be extremely helpful in attracting the right audience who will enjoy what you post.\n\n6. Make Sure Your Instagram Content is Accessible: Accessibility is key for online spaces. For example, you could include descriptions of the picture in each caption so that blind audiences can also enjoy your content. Make sure to avoid any videos with flashing lights, and avoid posting triggering content without a warning. Caring about your followers will go a long way in building brand loyalty in an audience.\n\n7. Work With Other Brands, Creators, and Influencers: You can also work with other Instagram brands and creators, as this will help draw people into your page from theirs and you can offer them the same thing. Brands tend to reach out to larger pages to offer sponsorships, but there's no reason you can't reach out to them first and see what you can build together.\n\n8. Start Creating Instagram Reels: Although Instagram has always been known as a picture platform, it's starting to become popular in the video space. Making reels with trending audio can help draw people in that might not have seen your page otherwise.\n\n9. Create Memes and Other Shareable Content: Making content that's shareable is another sure way to bring in audiences. For example, posting memes that people might relate to means they might share it on their story, exposing your Instagram to their followers. Make sure the memes are authentic to your page and the message you're trying to send.\n\n10. Run an Instagram Giveaway: You could also run an Instagram giveaway, mandating that people must comment on your post and follow your page to enter. Some giveaways also dictate that entrants must share the post, exposing the giveaway\u2014and therefore, the account\u2014to even more people.\n\nBuilding a following on Instagram is all about being authentic and true to yourself while creating content that your followers will love.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

He closed the door to his shop, and he and his wife ate their dinner and settled down for the night.\n\nUpon awakening the next morning, he was astounded to find a finished pair of shoes sitting on the work table! The stitches were perfect, and the shoes were the finest his shop had seen in a very, very long time. As luck would have it, a customer came in that day and purchased the shoes for a hefty price, and the old shoemaker was able to purchase two more pieces of leather which he carefully cut into pieces for sewing the next day. Yet the next day, lo and behold, two more marvelously crafted pairs of shoes awaited him on the work table! The aged shoemaker clasped his hands together in delight, and he was able to double his profits again that day. This pattern continued for weeks until finally, the old man decided to keep watch while hidden to see who his benefactors were. His wife decided to join him.\n\nHidden from view from the work table, the old shoemaker and his wife waited silently. They were flabbergasted to see two small, naked elves set to work on the cut pieces of leather on the table. The elves hummed to themselves all night long until the shoes were finished, and then they disappeared into the early morning light. Having quite a bit of profit now, the old woman chose some fine cloth and the old man bought the best leather, then they set about making tiny shoes, pants, shirts, and jackets for the little elves. That night, they left their gifts on the work table as a sign of their gratitude and hid once again to see their little friends.\n\n\"Oy, lookie here, mate!\" said the elf with ginger hair. His bearded companion said, \"Well, I'll be - it's clothes!\" They hastened to dress, then grasped hands and danced in circles on the work table. \"Good fortune to you, kind shoemaker!\" they whispered. \"Our work is done!\" And they disappeared into the night, leaving the shoemaker for good, but with enough wealth to live out his days.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Animal control is attempting to catch it but it keeps \"moo-ving\" too fast for them. We've also got a fender bender on Walton Rd which has led to a slowdown in the area. Finally, road crews have shut down Finch Dr completely so they can repair a broken water main in the area, I hope you brought your waders. If you ask me I'd say it's a good day to just stay at home. That's all for your traffic report. Be careful out there. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Can you suggest chores that are appropriate for a child who is who 5 years old?","prompt_id":"48363ab6108604ad6812a9dbe0f17fc52dc68532d3b3bf4d83bfadcea7b99f9a","messages":[{"content":"We want to teach our daughter the value of a clean home. Can you suggest chores that are appropriate for a child who is who 5 years old?","role":"user"},{"content":"No Problem! Here are some great chores for a 5-year-old to do. \n\n     \u2022 Vacuuming: Most kids love the vacuum so this is a great starter chore for a five-year-old. Make sure to go through the do\u2019s and don\u2019t of vacuuming and remind your child not everything gets picked up by a \n       vacuum. \n     \u2022 Bedroom Cleanup: Teach your child to take care of their bedrooms. Start with picking up toys, this can be made into a game by color or items. Another good way of teaching children to fine-tune their bedrooms is \n       lining up their shoes, making their beds, and ensuring nothing is out of order. \n     \u2022 Separate Laundry: At 5 a children can easily distinguish between colors, whites, and towels. Have your children separate the laundry to make the task of washing clothes easier and more efficient. \n     \u2022 Folding Laundry: This is a great time to teach children how to fold laundry. At 5 they won\u2019t be perfect but little hands can handle washcloths, hand towels, and mating socks. \n     \u2022 Putting Away Groceries: This is a good way for children to learn everything has a place to go. With your guidance, a small task like putting away groceries will teach them later on how to put away and keep things \n       neat. \n     \u2022 Dusting: Grab a duster and teach your child how to carefully remove things to dust tables, handrails, or other kid-friendly dustable areas. \n     \u2022 Set and Clean The Table: Most households with small kids have kid-friendly items for the table. Allow your child to set the table before dinner.  After dinner teach your child to remove their items and take them to \n        the kitchen sink to be rinsed off. This chore will become a healthy habit. \n     \u2022 Make The Bed: At five this won\u2019t be perfect, but a child will be able to learn to set the pillow properly and adjust their bedding so it's more tidy. If they use extra blankets at night teach them to put them away or \n       fold them at the bottom of the bed. Don\u2019t forget to adjust the stuffed animals!\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}
