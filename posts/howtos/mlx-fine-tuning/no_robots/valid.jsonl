At first, the area was mainly occupied by ranchers until the railroad in the early 1900s expanded tourism; it was made even easier for tourists to visit Williams when Route 66 was completed in 1926.\n\nHere are some things to consider doing while you spend your day in Williams, Arizona:\n\nOne of the top attractions tourists enjoy in town is the Grand Canyon Railway, a train that takes its passengers to and from the Grand Canyon\u2019s South Rim. The train ride is two hours each way, so plan accordingly.\n\nAnother option for exploring Williams is checking out the stretch of Route 66 in the town. This is an easily walkable loop and, if you visit at night, you can see some interesting vintage neon signs lit up along the road. Twisters Soda Fountain, Goldies Route 66 Diner, and Cruiser\u2019s Route 66 Cafe are among the local businesses found here.\n\nBearizona, located in Kaibab National Forest, is a unique drive-through wildlife park experience where visitors can witness wildlife from the comfort of their vehicle. Animals you might see here include the likes of black bears, wolves, bobcats, beavers, and badgers.\n\nIf you have any youths with you on your trip, they might enjoy a visit to Big Toy Playground, where guests (including adults) can operate large, earth-moving equipment for a dose of fun.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

At his point in his development, he has many trials ahead, though the objective is clear. After an unfortunate stroke of hard luck, there is little in the way of the economy that he may use to prepare. The call is made for a desperate -- but not uncommon -- play. He purchases what little he can from the store and readies himself for the difficult journey.\n\nHis spawn is favorable. Knife in hand, he takes the Western path from his spawn down into the shaded upper tunnels. This is where he must face his first hurdle -- one that all too often ends in a deadly outcome. The narrow corridor leading to the B-Site lies ahead. As expected, an incendiary grenade is lobbed in creating a dangerous hazard for him and his team. Luckily, he prepared for this. Dropping a smoke while he runs, the smoke dissipates the inferno -- creating safe passage at the cost of visibility. \n\nHe bursts through the smoke from the end of the corridor. On the site now, he scans for enemies. Detecting one in the Car position and one in the Window position, he relays this information to his team using short specialized barks frequently referred to as, \"calls.\" He trades damage with the enemy from Window before dispatching him with his less-than-optimal tools. The enemy at Car is dealt with by his teammates, though not without suffering casualties themselves.\n\nThe T-player sets the fuse, and the countdown timer to success begins. He holds an angle deep within the site checking the route he took earlier. Flanking enemies can be deadly. Patience is key. Seconds tick down toward the end. The enemy is out there. With no information, he can do little about it until they decide to engage. \n\nThen it happens. A flash. He tries to look away, but he is too late. His vision fills with white followed quickly by his own demise. The countdown ends as the opponents defuse the objective. Though the round was lost, with a plant on site, the T-side Player will have a better advantage on his next attempt.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Garlic spray controls fungal plant diseases like leaf spots, early and late blight, and powdery mildew. This spray also works as a contact insecticide. However, be aware it will kill pests and beneficial insects like ladybugs, so be mindful of your little garden helpers when applying it. \nDIY Garlic Spray to Control Insects and Fungus\n- 1 head of garlic\n- 2 cups of water\n- 1 tablespoon of bleach-free dish soap\n- 2 tablespoons of mineral or vegetable oil\nPeel the garlic, place the cloves and water in a food processor or blender, and liquefy. Let the mixture sit overnight. Then, strain out any remaining garlic pieces and pour the liquid into a clean spray bottle. Next, add the liquid dish soap and mineral or vegetable oil and shake the bottle vigorously to blend. \nSpray all plant parts thoroughly, including both sides of the leaves. Fungal spores tend to emerge on the leaves undersides, and it's also a favorite hiding spot for insects.\nThis DIY garlic spray is also an effective pest repellent. Use it wherever you notice significant pest activity in your garden. To avoid accidentally burning the plant's leaves, it's best to test home remedies like this on a small part of the plant first and monitor for any adverse reactions.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

The team consists of Mulder, a skilled criminal profiler, an ardent supernaturalist, and a conspiracy theorist who believes in the existence of the paranormal, and Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic who has been assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder's discoveries. \n The X-Files team got tasked to go to Corpus Christi, Texas to investigate a paranormal phenomenon. They arrived at Corpus Christi and immediately started their investigation by interviewing witnesses and victims of the paranormal phenomenon. From what they gathered from the interviews, the paranormal phenomenon occurs in a bar called \"La Terra del Mar\", when a song from the band Led Zepplin called \"Stairway to Heaven\" is played in a jukebox at the same time someone climbs the stairs to the basement. The persons seem to disappear for a few days, later to be found naked in nearby woods. \n One person that refused to do an interview was the owner of the bar. This gave a sign to Scully and Mulder, and they thought it was a scam to generate publicity, but they had to do their investigation.\n One day has passed since they arrived at Corpus Christi and they decided to make a reservation for dinner for two at the bar. The night set, and they went to the bar, they entered the bar, and the owner immediately became nervous. The owner asked them to leave but they refuse since they had to do their investigation. If the owner didn't comply, they would get a warrant. He broke down in tears explaining the bar was the only thing he has, and if there is something paranormal in his bar, the government would take the bar from him. \n Scully laugh and said the case could easily be solved if he played the song while she would go up the stairs. Mulder did exactly that he changed the song from the jukebox to \"Stairway to Heaven\" and Scully began to climb the stairs. Mulder lost sight of Scully and after waiting for a couple of seconds he turned off the music and went to check on Scully in the basement, but she wasn't there.

The group called themselves the Committee of Safety \u2014 six citizens of the Kingdom and seven foreign residents of Hawaii (five Americans, one Scotsman, and one German). Their ultimate goal was annexation to the United States. It would be five years, however, until that goal was achieved.\n\nThe plan to overtake Hawaii\u2019s monarchy had been brewing for decades. It flared up during the reign of Queen Liliuokalani, Kalakaua\u2019s sister who succeeded him as monarch on January 29, 1891, after the king\u2019s death.\n\nIn early 1892, a secret group \u2014 the Annexation Club \u2014 was formed by Lorrin A. Thurston, a leading politician, lawyer, businessman and native-born citizen of the Kingdom. The club\u2019s goal was to be ready to act if the queen carried out their worst fear \u2013 proposing a lenient constitution to replace the restrictive one forced on Kalakaua in 1887. That document, the Bayonet Constitution, had been authored by Thurston and it had severely limited the monarch\u2019s power.\n\nAfter much agitation and maneuvering on both sides of the political fence, on January 14, 1893, the queen informed her Cabinet that she intended to propose a new constitution. The Annexation Club quickly learned of her plans and formed the Committee of Safety from among its members. They were able to gain the support of the US government minister John L. Stevens and Captain G. C. Wiltse of the USS Boston, the fully armed US warship anchored in Honolulu Harbor. The queen\u2019s Cabinet refused to support her and any new constitution she offered.\n\nIn an effort to ease tensions, Liliuokalani issued a proclamation that any changes she would seek to the constitution would be accomplished within the framework of the current one. But it was too late to turn back the rising tide of the businessmen who saw their opportunity to finally do away with the monarchy. On January 16, 162 US sailors and marines were landed. The next day, the Committee of Safety issued their proclamation declaring martial law, deposing the queen, and establishing the Provisional Government until such time as union with the US could be attained. At the urging of her Cabinet, the queen surrendered her power to the US government and departed the Palace for her private home nearby. By midnight, almost all of the 17 foreign consuls in Honolulu had recognized the new government, including Stevens and Japanese Consul-General Saburo Fujii.\n\nThe newly formed government immediately sent envoys to Washington DC to seek a treaty of annexation. Likewise, the Royalist faction sent envoys to plead the queen\u2019s case. In the end, an annexation treaty was sent to Congress, but upon the inauguration of Grover Cleveland as US President in early March, the treaty was quickly withdrawn.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese Navy warship HIJM Naniwa, arrived in Honolulu on February 23, 1893, to provide protection for Japanese citizens and express Japanese concern after the overthrow of the monarchy. The cruiser remained in Honolulu until May 11, 1893.\n\nIn December 1893, President Cleveland criticized the involvement of American troops in the coup as a misuse of the power of the United States. Senate hearings followed, but Congress did not act to either restore the monarchy or annex Hawaii.\n\nWith their goal of annexation stalled, the leaders of the Provisional Government decided to form themselves into the Republic of Hawaii. On July 2, 1894, their new constitution was ratified and Sanford B. Dole, who had been president of the Provisional Government, was endorsed as president for a six-year term. Dole, a Hawaiian citizen from a missionary family, was a cousin to James D. Dole, who would arrive in the islands from Boston in 1899 and develop the pineapple industry.\n\nThe constitution of the Republic of Hawaii required voters to swear allegiance to the republic. Native Hawaiians refused, but foreigners who had sided with the overthrow were allowed to vote. Strict property and other requirements prevented most Hawaiians and all Asians from voting.\n\nThe following month, a delegation of Royalists went to Washington again in an effort to convince Cleveland to restore Liliuokalani to the throne. It was too late, was the reply. The president had done all he could and turned the entire affair over to Congress, who continued to do nothing. The US had officially recognized the new government; there was nothing more to be done.\n\nRealizing that their only hope was to take matters into their own hands, on January 6, 1895, after months of planning, several hundred Native Hawaiians and other Royalists mounted a counterrevolution to restore the monarchy. However, due to lack of organization and government spies in their midst, within three days the attempt had failed. The insurgents were arrested and imprisoned. On January 16, 1895, Liliuokalani was arrested at her private home, Washington Place, taken to her former Palace, now the capitol of the Republic of Hawaii, and imprisoned in an upstairs room.

This was the life I was getting used to in a state park that was a good 50 miles away from any signs of civilization. I was always in good health, everything was peaceful, and rarely did I feel \"tired.\"\n\nI decided to get in touch with my very active friends on the information superhighway, and one of them informed me about a job opportunity in an extravagant senior living community. It was a \"concrete\" job offer, and I would get a \"raise\" if the residents failed to heed any warnings about slowing down. I accepted the offer on the condition that I would need a ride over there and a crew promptly came and picked me up. I felt elated and thought to myself \"At long last, I'm paving my way toward great success!\"\n\nUnfortunately, the new job has turned into a nightmare. The crew slammed me into the ground, poured a layer of blacktop over me, and made sure that I couldn't move; one could say that I was \"tarred and tethered.\" Then there is the ungodly traffic! These seniors think that they are still 18; 50 miles per hour is their usual speed, but there is this one grandma from Pasadena who just can't seem to keep her foot off of the accelerator! Her extremely excessive speed has now given me constant back pain.\n\nI decided to take the senior community to court due to negligence; I \"pitched\" my case to the judge, but he decided that I didn't have a good enough \"resin\" to pursue charges.\n\nSo here I stay in this community. Now I'm even more scared because my co-worker 1000 feet behind me says that there is a shuffleboard tournament starting next week and all nearby communities are invited! In conclusion, all I can advise my fellow speedbumps is: \"Don't take these matters lying down, and make sure that you get No (As)Phalt Insurance.\"","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}
{"prompt":"What is the most common Dene name for Yellowknife? What does it translate to in English?\n\nSituated on the Northern shore of Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and the largest city in the NWT. Founded in 1934, the city is located in the traditional territory of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation who founded the nearby community of Dettah in the early 1930s.\n\nRegardless of what time of year you visit, there's always something happening in Yellowknife. From a weekend music festival in the sand to a month of festivities inside a snow castle on the frozen bay, the capital of the Northwest Territories is a vibrant and cosmopolitan northern city.\n\nHere you'll find excellent restaurants, comfy accommodations and a whole host of colourful locals. One of the best things about Yellowknife, though, is its location. The bustling streets are filled with trendy shops and public art, but take a few steps out of town and you're surrounded by untouched northern wilderness. In Yellowknife, you're never more than a few minutes away from a new adventure.\n\nThe city gets its name from the copper tools historically made and traded by the local Dene. The most common Dene name for Yellowknife is \"Somba K'e,\" which translates to \"Where the money is.\" It's a fitting title for a town with a gold-mining history. Yellowknife was officially founded in 1934, when the area today called Old Town was little more than a few cabins and a rough-and-tumble mining camp. It evolved into the seat of the territorial government\u2014a legacy still on display at the Legislative Assembly\u2014before another mining boom arrived in the '90s with the discovery of nearby diamond deposits.\n\nToday, tourism is one of the biggest draws to Yellowknife. Visitors come from all over the world to experience Yellowknife's incredible attractions. Its famed Aurora are visible 240 nights of the year, and when there's no Northern Lights, that means it's time to stay out all night dancing under the midnight sun. Does it get cold? Oh, you bet. But that doesn't stop Yellowknifers from having fun all winter long. Yellowknife is also the perfect launching point for northern adventures outside of the city. A wide array of trails, lodges, campgrounds, bush plane tours, and secret fishing spots are all easily accessible from this free-spirited community.\n\nAnd it's friendly too. Make your way to any Yellowknife establishment and you'll find locals eager to advise you of how to get the most out of your visit. You'll be so full of suggestions for great meals, gorgeous hikes, fabulous handmade arts and crafts and truly unique experiences, you'll be wondering how you can extend your stay in this vibrant and culturally-diverse city.\n\nThe City of Yellowknife has additional up-to-date resources and information about local events, accommodations, and amenities at extraordinaryyk.com as well as municipal information at yellowknife.ca.

FYI, I live in a condo community, within a suburban metropolitan region.","role":"user"},{"content":"Trash littered within a community is unpleasant and can be hard to prevent if the culprits are unknown. Here are some ways to prevent trash from being littered in your community.\n\n1) Engage the HOA\nHOA groups often create and enforce policies for the residential communities they manage. Most likely, you are not the only resident observing the trash being littered around your neighborhood and there is a high chance that other neighbors share the discontent. If your townhouse community has an HOA, bringing this issue to their attention at the next HOA meeting may be a good way to start. With enough support from other residents and approval from the HOA board, guidelines can be set restricting any trash to be littered. HOA often also have the power, written into the contractual agreements signed by residents before move-in, to enforce rules they set. Penalties for residents refusing to comply with rules may range from thousands of dollars in fees to eviction. If new HOA rules making improper disposal of trash can be set, then residents will have to eventually comply, assuming the root cause is from within the community. HOAs may even help lead preventative strategies attempting to proactively address the problem. Some strategies include the installation of waste baskets for general use, increasing the frequency of waste management services, installing street signs, and\/or employing third-party street cleaning services. \n\n2) Establish a Neighborhood Watch Group\nA neighborhood watch, also called a crime watch is an organized group of civilians devoted to crime and vandalism prevention within a neighborhood, including littering. Similar to HOA organizations, members of watch groups are often intrinsically motivated to maintain a clean neighborhood and share the same common goals. Neighborhood watch groups can be as informal or formal as one would like, although informal methods may be easier to start if your community does not have such a group in place already. Typically, informal watch groups involve select community residents patrolling and monitoring the community looking out for any suspicious activity, crime, or other behavior breaking rules. A schedule is usually shared between volunteers listing out availabilities, procedures in case of emergencies, and contact information, including local law enforcement. Having an active neighborhood watch group monitoring the community will likely deter the culprits. Although the initial purpose of starting a watch group may be to catch and deter litterers, it is possible that the group also inadvertently encounters more serious and dangerous criminals who have gone unnoticed in the past. Depending on the danger of the threats, and if the watch group volunteers are inexperienced or untrained in handling more threatening situations, then risks can quickly escalate beyond what was anticipated. Therefore, the safety of the volunteers within the group is an important concern and should remain a high priority. \n\n3) Contact local law enforcement\nLaw enforcement will likely be able to assist in preventing trash to be littered in your community. Law enforcement is a public service and it can be argued that trash is impeding the well-being of the local public. A big advantage of involving law enforcement over creating a local neighborhood watch group is that the former has extensive experience and training in dealing with a wide range of threats, while the latter may not. For example, if the litterers also coincidentally happen to be wanted fugitives then law enforcement would be prepared to apprehend the criminals safely away from the community residents. Another advantage of involving law enforcement to eliminate trash being littered in your community is that they can adjust their levels of engagement depending on the severity of the issues. If the trash being littered is largely immaterial or non-threatening, then they may elect to install street signs warning culprits of the consequences of littering or occasionally patrol the street in marked police cars. Law enforcement may even leave a marked police car in plain sight within the community since the sight of a police car is known to reduce the chances of criminal activity in most cases. However, if trash being littered is significantly harming the residents (e.g., hazardous materials, food waste, heavy items, etc.), then law enforcement will likely elect to increase their engagement and may even dedicate an officer present at all times. As illustrated, some of the benefits of contacting law enforcement are the flexibility of engagement, the depth of their expertise, and nearly unlimited resources in combatting the littering issue.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

I am writing to ask for your consideration of an idea that could significantly improve the safety of our town's roadways - changing the color of all stop signs from red to a more prominent and attention-grabbing color.\n\nAs I am sure you are aware, stop signs serve as an integral aspect of our roadway system, providing essential control for the safety of motorists and pedestrians alike. However, despite their importance, traditional red stop signs seem to blend into the background of our lives, particularly during bad weather conditions, in very congested areas, or in areas with dense foliage.\n\nConsidering the increase in challenges facing drivers in our town, I propose a switch from the conventional red color to a more visually striking color, such as fluorescent orange or neon yellow, or blue. By utilizing a more attention-grabbing, less standard color, we can improve stop sign visibility and ensure that drivers and pedestrians see them from a greater distance.\n\nThe benefits of such a change would be twofold. The change would enhance road safety by lessening the risk of accidents caused by drivers failing to notice stop signs. Improved visibility of stop signs would also help pedestrians who rely on stop signs for their safety.\n\nIn addition, changing the color of stop signs would positively impact traffic flow and reduce congestion. With better stop sign visibility, drivers would be better equipped to anticipate upcoming intersections, aiding in smoother transitions. With this one small modification, we could create a more efficient and organized transportation system in our town.\n\nWhile I understand that any change should be thoroughly evaluated and considered, I request that you initiate a feasibility study as soon as possible. I firmly believe that implementing this change would be a proactive step towards prioritizing a safe driving experience in our town. Taking action demonstrates a commitment to enhancing road safety and making our community a better place to live.\n\nThank you in advance for your attention to this important matter. I am more than willing to offer any assistance to support this initiative.

At first, people found it funny \u2013 these maidens desperately looked for lizards, toads, or turtles, swallowing their fear and disgust to kiss the creatures. But when one of the maidens came upon a venomous snake and attempted to kiss it, the townspeople knew the problem had gone beyond mere jokes.\nThen, older women became victims of it. And when no reptile or amphibian would do, they began terrorizing pets and farm animals with kisses. Things really went south when a woman insisted that she must plant a kiss on the head of a wild wolf. It seems she did not mind or couldn\u2019t fathom the wolf taking her head with the kiss!\nAnd so, your Majesty, I write to you because you must take responsibility for this. After all, you were a frog that turned into a prince when your queen kissed you. How then, can you blame the womenfolk for finding their own royal spouse through such measures? I don\u2019t know what you will say to dissuade them. I\u2019m afraid if you tell them you were cursed, these same women will seek out witches to do the same, and their business will boom.\nI eagerly await your response, as the situation is quite dire indeed. Only yesterday I had to fight off four women and a maiden who had broken into my pigsty and insisted upon turning my pigs into their princes with a kiss. Please address this issue or I will start charging them, and there\u2019s no way you could place taxes on it either.\nYours humbly,\nAn alarmed peasant.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

It is comprised of five sections which combine to present a bleak picture of the landscape and history of the contemporary world. This poem has a rich array of voices which includes numerous references from diverse literary and cultural sources such as Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, and more. Eliot began work on the poem in 1914 and completed it in 1919 after a breakdown caused by his father's death. The poem has largely been read as a comment on the bleakness of post-war Europe, and the pervasive metaphor of dryness is read as a metaphor for spiritual emptiness.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Open QA"}

When analyzing the story from the critical perspective of feminism, there is a clear discrepancy in how the woman and men are described and the roles they play within the story. Women are debased to their looks and manner, only being truly valued when they appeal to the needs and wants of the men around them. This is consistent with one of Stoker\u2019s common concerns which is gender roles. He used this theme in several ways throughout the text, but it can be seen distinctly in the graveyard scene. Stoker uses a theme of the fear of the unknown to achieve a separation between the men and the women within the churchyard scene. By instructing Mina to stay behind, the characters physically separate themselves from the women in the story. Additionally, the fact that Lucy is a supernatural being rather than a human within that scene contributes to the idea that women are separate and lesser than whilst also being a compelling gothic convention. It is an obvious portrayal of dehumanization. This is also achieved through how they are speaking about Lucy in the tomb. It becomes clear that the value of the women in the story is confined to their usefulness and appeal to the men around them. They talk of how killing her will result in the return of her beauty and how she will revert back to Arthur\u2019s Lucy and be at rest. This scene is poignant as it is a group of men deciding the fate of a woman based on the idea that she has strayed away from their ideal. Whilst this is understandable under the circumstances, within the scope of Stoker's concerns it adopts a larger significance and comes to represent the idea that women should be predictable and ownable. Uncontrolled women are a danger to the society that they exist within. So in a way, the obstruction of agency that the male characters inflict upon Lucy and Mina is representative of a larger fear of the unknown. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

My name is Monique, and I was once an adolescent girl. I know, it seems impossible to imagine, when you see before you the weathered face of a sixty-year-old. But yes, once upon a time, a long time ago, I was 13. It was a difficult age, with so many changes going on with my body and only a horrid, condescending shrew of a stepmother to help me through it. My mother had run off with some army soldier when I was 3, leaving the child-rearing to a cold and distant father, a career Army man himself.\n\nWith my mother gone, I was lacking the kind, understanding female mentor to help me through things like periods, bras, and the hormonal onslaught that comes with an awareness of that previously vile creature, the \u201cboy.\u201d\n\n2. Like so many other days, I started my diary entry today with the following: \u201cMy name is Holly, and I hate my life.\u201d For a moment, I lifted my pen and contemplated what made this day different from any other? My thought was punctuated by a teardrop, slowly spreading across the page.\n\nLet\u2019s see:  my dad is either at work all of the time or he\u2019s at home and angry. He resents my mother dying and leaving him the single parent of an -- I can admit it -- difficult 14-year-old. I could make life easier for him, and maybe I should, but why should I have to be the one keeping their emotions in check? I\u2019m a teenager. He\u2019s the parent. He needs to stop being a complete jerk.\n\n3. They say when you\u2019re near death, your life flashes before your eyes. In my experience, I found that to be true. In the seconds between losing control of my car and slamming into a tree, a lifetime of memories replayed in my brain.\n\nThere were memories of lying in a crib and looking up at my parents\u2019 smiling faces. There were memories of the world wobbling through my eyes as I toddled around, taking my first steps. I could recall with perfect accuracy my fourth-grade spelling bee, and how I lost it on such an easy word, \u201cinextricably.\u201d But where my memory paused the longest was adolescence, that wonderful and terrible dichotomy of \u201cbecoming a woman,\u201d and everything that entailed.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

A study by the Journal of Applied Physiology suggests eating about 1 gram of protein per pound of your body mass every day.\n\n2) Eat more calories - To pack on the muscle, you need to consume a caloric surplus, that is, eat more calories than you use in a day.\n\n3) Focus more on compound movements - Exercises such as deadlifts and squats target several exercises and these should form the backbone of your workouts, as opposed to isolation exercises like bicep curls.\n\n4) Lift heavy - Low rep exercises with heavy weights build more strength and size than high rep exercises with lower weights\n\n5) Try a carb loaded, amino acid packed shake pre-workout - Drinking a pre-workout shake with carbohydrates and amino acids increases protein synthesis, according to a 2001 study by the University of Texas. You need to add 10 to 20 grams of protein (about a scoop of whey powder) to your shake.\n\n6) Take time to recover - Don't work out to the point of exhaustion more than 3 times a week, and never on consecutive days. This gives your muscles time to recover and grow.\n\n7) Eat carbs after working out - Research shows that post-workout meals with carbs stimulate insulin production, thus stimulating muscle growth.\n\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Just about in the center of this meadow, there is a massive willow tree, with branches gnarled and a trunk twisting up to the sky. Hanging from these branches are a myriad of curious slings and hammocks that appear to be woven from the bark of the willow, undoubtedly making this tree a popular rest area for many local creatures. The stoic willow gives off a serene sense of peace and wisdom, seeming to look over the meadow as a caring grandmother.\n\nSpotted all around this clearing are bunches of vibrantly colored mushrooms  If you were to happen to walk past these particular mushrooms, you would be greeted in cheerful singsong voices. These mushrooms can be overheard gossiping about the local woodland drama and when that grows thin, the weather makes just as fine a subject.\n\nTucked back among the leaves beside the meadow, where you would probably never even notice, lies a dragon's verdant den. She often appears to sun herself and perhaps join in with some of the gossiping. One excellent afternoon, she is happened upon by a good-looking emerald dragon, who happens to be new to this area. It is not long before the pair find themselves trying not to get caught stealing shy looks from across the meadow.\n\nWith each \"chance\" encounter, the pair's friendship blossoms as they tell the tales that dragons tell, sitting beneath the willow. Their laughter can be heard echoing over the mushrooms' chatter. The emerald dragon's genuine personality and peculiar sense of humor win over the decidedly solitary female. His brazen good looks probably didn't hurt, either. \n \nIn a tale as old as time, the two dragons realize they have fallen deeply and utterly in love.

From pejorative names such as monkey meat or mystery meat to the many songs soldiers have written to denounce its salty, uniform, partially jellified consistency, Spam has rarely been described with particular fondness. This is particularly true in the United States, the country of its origin. But did you know that Spam played a vital role in the war effort?\n\nAs a calorie and protein-dense foodstuff that could be shipped overseas in durable cans, Spam was an obvious asset to military planners. Spam tins fed allies in Britain, North Africa, and on the Eastern Front, where millions of cans were shipped to the Soviet Union under lend-lease. For starving populations, it was a dense can of life-saving meat, and the great industrial engine of the United States could produce them in heroic quantities. \n\nPerhaps too heroic, however. While Spam was certainly an improvement over the bully beef and salt pork that had fed previous generations of soldiers, the Army's reliance on it grew monotonous to many soldier's palates. Spam tins were happily traded off to civilians wherever soldiers were stationed, or even given away freely or discarded. A side effect of this is the creation of dishes such as Budae-jjigae, a Korean stew that had its origins around US Army bases. Korea, ravaged by war, was in short supply of food. In particular short supply was meat, and Spam filled the gap for many Koreans just as it had for the populations of Europe during WW2. Spam may not have been gourmet, but it was a standby that served its purpose faithfully for people in dire circumstances across the world.  ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Introduce yourself, get to know people, make friends and go out to eat together. Bond with people and create incredible memories with those that you cross paths with.\n\n- Be considerate: Don\u2019t touch other people's stuff and be mindful when coming home that others may be sleeping. Use a cellphone flashlight to navigate at night and avoid turning the light on. Respect the quiet hours and be sure that when it's time to sleep your actions don\u2019t prevent others from getting some shut-eye.\n\n- Bring what you need to the shower: Bring everything you need to the shower so you can do everything in there. Don\u2019t walk back to the room in your towel. Be sure to have a towel and either bring one or get one from the hostel staff. Bring sandals for the walk\n\n- Practice kitchen etiquette: Clean up after yourself in the kitchen, there are no maids and no one wants to clean up a mess that\u2019s not theirs. Don\u2019t eat other people\u2019s food unless told it\u2019s okay. Make sure you aren\u2019t leaving anything behind.\n\n- Bring earplugs and a face mask: You can\u2019t predict the nighttime habits of your roommates or whether or not they will snore. Be sure to bring earplugs and a facemask to help shut out the outside world and allow yourself to get the best possible sleep.\n\n- Have check-in info ready: For the fastest and smoothest experience have your check-in information and confirmation ready before you arrive so you can easily provide it and quickly get checked into your room.\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

The first and perhaps most obvious choice would be to utilize other social media platforms to their full potential\u2014it\u2019s no longer just Facebook! Businesses can use Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram to promote products and services. Keep in mind that every platform has its own algorithm, so post strategically!\n2. In today\u2019s world, it\u2019s a huge disadvantage not to have your own business website. You may not have to rely on social media with a website! Using a blog, you can optimize keywords in order to rank high in search engine results. This can make you highly visible to prospective customers.\n3. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of PR! Getting featured in the news, magazines, and other online articles can definitely skyrocket your business success without Facebook.\n4. Podcasts can greatly promote your business, and it\u2019s easier than many realize. Since you\u2019ll be on major platforms, it\u2019s a possibility your podcast will be recommended to thousands of people.\n5. Traveling and public speaking bring your business back to a classic marketing tactic that will never go extinct: word of mouth. Once others have attended your event, they can go on to tell others all around the world. \n6. If you can grow an email list, you might find that you don\u2019t need to use Facebook to market your business. \n7. Paying for ads is always an option to grow your brand without Facebook. You can customize nearly every aspect of your ad, even where it shows up for others! While it may not be in every budget, it\u2019s a viable option.\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

","role":"user"},{"content":"\n-\tPowder bed fusion (PBF) machines require a very large amount of powdered build material even for a design that itself doesn\u2019t take up much volume. The 3D object is built up layer-by-layer by depositing a layer of powdered material (often metal) on a build surface called a \u201cbed\u201d and melting or sintering the portions of it that correspond with the final item\u2019s solid structure. A new layer of powder is then spread over that, and the next \u201cslice\u201d worth of material is sintered on top of the previous one. In the end, the entire print bed volume will be filled with powder, much of which is not fused.\n-\tBy contrast, directed energy deposition (DED) printers funnel powder through nozzles mounted around their energy source (a laser, electric arc, or electron beam). The energy source melts a small portion of the underlying structure and adds the new powder to that position, building it up by a small amount. Since the powder is only added to the point of construction, it uses far less powder than PBF printers.\n-\tLike most 3D printers, PBF machines can only print top-down. Overhanging parts can, however, be supported by the previous layers of unsintered powder below and don't technically require support structures to be printed. Many DED printers can also print without building support structures, but they do so by rotating the print nozzle head at angles that most printers cannot achieve.\n-\tIn most cases, the build volumes of both types of machines need to be flooded with inert gas to prevent melted material from oxidizing. Some DED printers have fewer strictures and can get away with only blowing the inert gas over the melted section below the nozzle. Electron-beam DED printers are more restrictive, however, and require the build volume to be evacuated to a near vacuum so that the electron stream does not interact with gas molecules on its way to the powder. \n-\tDED printers can typically be built with larger print volumes than can PBF machines.\n-\tOf the two, DED is the newer technology, so fewer operators have the skills necessary to make the most of these machines.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Here is a list of places to see in Liechtenstein.\n\nVaduz: The Capital City\nThe Liechtenstein Center, a visitor information center, is the first place you want to visit in Vaduz. Here you'll find information about the sites, what they cost, when they are open and maps showing you how to get there. In addition to its beauty, Vaduz is the smallest capital in Europe which makes walking from one site to another a breeze. You can explore the historic small town, or \nSt\u00e4dtle, visit the Landtag, which is Liehtenstein's parliament building built near the Rhine River. If you get tired, there are plenty of good restaurants available along with local stores. \nOne place you don't want to miss is Schloss Vaduz or the Vaduz Castle. Built in the 12th century, Schloss Vaduz, also called The Princely House of Liechtenstein, serves as a home for the royal monarchs. \n\nThe Treasure Chamber of the Principality of Liechtenstein in Vaduz\nSixteen monarchs have sat on the Liechtenstein throne since 1608. The Treasure Chamber of the Principality of Liechtenstein houses 400 years of royal treasures and artwork collected during that time. Two particular highlights are a collection of Easter eggs some of which were created by Karl Faberg\u00e9 and notable works of art such as Johann Ludwig Bleuler's  \"Rhine Journey\" paintings. In contrast, weapons and artifacts collected over the centuries are displayed in the Treasure Chamber along with space rocks from the moon. \n\nSchellenberg Castles\nTake a side trip to Schellenberg and explore two medieval castles in one visit. Build in 1200, the Upper Castle (Obere Burg) was used as living quarters until the 16th century when it was abruptly abandoned. The castles fell into disrepair until 1956 when the monarchy turned the castles over to the Historical Association of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The Lower Castle (Untere Burg) is the smaller of the two castles. The site is free to visit and is well worth the trip. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

I haven't looked back since! \nThere are a lot of cool facts that people don't know about the Spice Girls, which is why I'm writing this post today. Follow along with me as I take you through the history of these girl power icons. \n\nThe Early Days [H2]\nThe Spice Girls first got their start in 1994. It's wild to think that nearly 30 years have passed since then! The girls had to audition for the group, which led to the five members - Mel B, Melanie C, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell, and Victoria Beckham. \n\nFirst Steps [H3]\nWhen the Spice Girls started, they wanted to pave their own path. They signed with Virgin Records and soon put out my favorite Spice Girls track called \"Wannabe\" in 1996. Did you know that the Spice Girls' first album sold over 20 million copies globally? They were truly a record-breaking girl group. \n\nSpiceworld Tour [H3]\nBy 1998, these girls were on a roll and ready to tour the world. Millions of people showed up to their shows, and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on tickets. But sadly, Ginger Spice was ready to leave the band at this point.\n\nLater Career [H3]\nDespite the changes in the lineup, the Spice Girls continued to release some amazing songs, like the ever-famous \"Goodbye\". By the time the new millennium arrived, the Spice Girls were fizzling out, much to my chagrin. \n\nLooking Back at the Spice Girls Today [H2]\nIn the nearly three decades that the Spice Girls have existed, they've broken a lot of female pop star boundaries! The group has sold 100 million records globally, become one of the most successful British pop groups since the Beatles, and won numerous industry awards. \n\nThese girls will forever inspire me!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Please use a neutral, semi-formal tone and write at an 11th grade reading level.","role":"user"},{"content":"Improper watering is among the most common causes of yellowing leaves in snake plants. Chronic overwatering often causes the plant's roots to suffocate in the oversaturated soil. When this happens, the roots cannot absorb water and nutrients properly, leading to yellowing leaves and stunted growth. Furthermore, overwatering also creates favorable conditions for bacterial and fungal infections, which further damage the plant.\n\nOn the other hand, underwatering can also lead to snake plants' leaves turning yellow. When the plant doesn't get enough water, it cannot perform photosynthesis efficiently, which leads to a lack of chlorophyll production in the leaves. This results in yellowed leaves that eventually dry out and fall off. Additionally, underwatering causes the soil to become compact and dry, making it difficult for the roots to absorb water and nutrients. Therefore, giving your snake plant the appropriate amount of water is essential to maintain healthy leaves and overall plant growth.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

When the daughter sat in my chair, I asked her to take her hair down so that I could brush through it before we started her ombre colour. When she took her hair down, I noticed it was much longer than I expected. I asked her how long her hair was, and she said it was knee length. She brushed her hair back so that it was all going down the back of the chair and it was well past the length I was comfortable cutting at. I would have had to kneel down the colour and cut her hair.

Because of the length of her hair, it can be challenging to find a hair stylist who will work on her. Our usual stylist is away on holiday, but my friend recommended someone new to try. So I called the salon to book a trim and an ombre colour. When I spoke to the receptionist, I specifically asked if the stylist could cut long hair. The receptionist assured me that this stylist was fine with long hair. \nMy daughter and I went to the salon for our appointment with my daughter's hair tied up in a bun. I met the new stylist and thanked her for fitting my daughter in since, again, we weren't regular clients and my daughter has long hair. The stylist took my daughter to the chair, covered her with the gown, and then asked my daughter to take her hair down to be brushed out. My daughter did as she was asked and then everything went wrong. The stylist immediately waved me over while telling my daughter to remove the gown. When I asked what the problem was, the stylist told me that my daughter's hair was too long. \nI was upset as I had specifically said she had long hair when booking the appointment. The stylist explained that she assumed long hair meant waist length, not knee length as my daughter's hair is and that she couldn't physically cut it because she has knee problems that prevent her from kneeling to do so. This was never conveyed to me before the appointment, so I requested my \u00a350 booking fee be refunded. This is when things got worse. The stylist refused to refund the booking fee and insisted that I was told it was non-refundable when I booked, but clearly they didn't communicate with me the requirements on hair length while I was booking either. I demanded to speak to the manager. \nThe stylist brought the owner over who did agree to refund the \u00a350. The stylist again tried to blame me for the ordeal by insisting I should have been more specific about the hair length, but neither the stylist nor receptionist ever asked me for more details so I didn't expect it to be a problem. I was angry at the behaviour and contempt shown to me and my daughter by the stylist so after we left, I went onto the salon's Facebook stage to leave a detailed review of my experience and warn everyone that this stylist doesn't actually cut long hair necessarily. I'm still upset at the way my daughter and I were treated. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

{"prompt":"Turn the facts in this paragraph into a series of questions with answers\n\nParticle accelerators are devices that speed up the particles that make up all matter in the universe and collide them together or into a target. This allows scientists to study those particles and the forces that shape them. Specifically, particle accelerators speed up charged particles. These are particles with a positive or negative electrical charge such as protons, atomic nuclei, and the electrons that orbit atomic nuclei. In some cases, these particles reach speeds close to the speed of light. When the particles then collide with targets or other particles, the collisions that result can release energy, produce nuclear reactions, scatter particles, and produce other particles, such as neutrons. This gives scientists a look at what holds atoms, atomic nuclei, and nucleons together, as well as the world of particles like the Higgs boson. These particles and forces are the subject of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Scientists also get insights into the quantum physics that govern how the world behaves at incredibly small scales.

What are some high-calorie foods that are cheap? I live in the USA, so I have access to most foods.","role":"user"},{"content":"Here are five cheap foods in the USA that are high in calories. It's important to note that costs will differ based on location!\n\n1. Canola Oil\nYou wouldn't eat canola oil alone, but that's why it's great for weight gain. You can easily add it to other meals and boost your calorie intake with little effort. With 240 calories in 2 tbsp of canola oil, it certainly packs a punch. Canola oil is comparatively really cheap, also. You can usually buy a gallon for around $10. \n\nCanola oil is pretty versatile as well in terms of how you can get it into your diet. You can drizzle it on salads, fry things, or baste your meat with it. There is no shortage of ways to easily add calories when you use canola oil. \n\n2. Potatoes\nPotatoes are perfect for gaining weight. High in carbs, high in calories, found everywhere, and pretty cheap, too. There are many ways to cook potatoes and have them as the main ingredient or the side of a dish. In terms of calories per dollar, potatoes are very competitive, with a pound of potatoes costing around $1. Not as cheap as canola oil, but potatoes are also far easier to have a lot of, especially when butter is added. \n\nPotatoes can be added to so many dishes. Making up a bulk of mashed potatoes and eating them as a snack is pretty easy. They can be boiled, mashed, baked, stewed, or fried when cooking.\n\n3. White Rice\nWhite rice has been a high-calorie food used worldwide for a long time. Rice can be found everywhere. It's extremely cheap, and best of all, it can be the base of so many great-tasting dishes or even just added as a side to many others. Rice has a staggering 2,860 calories per roughly $1 when you buy in bulk, which is a great price.\n\nRice can be used as the base of curries, added to soups and stews, go in tacos, burritos, and so much more. Rice is easy to cook and can be stored in the fridge for leftovers.\n\n4. Pancake Batter\nWhy not start your day with a high-calorie-dense breakfast that leaves you wanting to eat more throughout the day? Pancake batter is delicious, cheap, and high in calories. A 2lb box of pancake mix will cost somewhere around $2 and give you over 2,000 calories on its own, but when you add butter, milk, and syrup, you'll get an even higher calorie content.\n\nYou can also use pancake batter to make other things, such as muffins. \n\n5. Whole Chicken\nWhole chickens are incredible for calories and are usually in every major grocery store for bargain prices. These usually come pre-cooked, too, meaning you won't have to worry. You can buy a whole chicken cooked for $4.99 at Costco. That chicken should provide you with over 3,250 calories. That equals 650 calories a dollar. \n\nChicken isn't the best on the list for calories per dollar but it's probably the best for versatility and ease of cooking. Consider trying a rice meal with chicken to get an easy high, calorie meal. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

This distinction has interesting implications in the context of deception and lying. A Duchenne smile is considered a genuine smile. It involves both the zygomatic major muscle, which pulls up the corners of the mouth, and the orbicularis oculi muscle, causing the eyes to 'crinkle' or 'twinkle'. Duchenne smiles are often associated with genuine, spontaneous expressions of positive emotion and are difficult to fake because the orbicularis oculi is not typically under conscious control. In contrast, a non-Duchenne smile, also known as a social or polite smile, involves only the zygomatic major muscle. The eyes do not show the characteristic crinkle. These smiles can be easily fabricated, and are therefore often associated with politeness or masking true feelings, including deception.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Open QA"}

While the average temperature hovers around 90 degrees Fahrenheit through most of the summer, the rising humidity can make it feel well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Plus, humidity adds a sticky quality to the air, which increases how much you sweat and how much your body temperature rises in response to the heat outside. \n\nWhile many North Carolinians opt to stay inside in air-conditioned homes for most of the summer, those that love being outdoors, or have to be outdoors for work, need ways to beat the heat. Below you\u2019ll find four ways to cool down and stave off rising temperatures in NC this summer. \n\n\u2022 Sip ice water throughout the day. Being properly hydrated will replenish your body\u2019s water supply, encouraging stabilization of body temperature. You could also suck on ice chips to get the same effect. \n\nSide Tip: At the height of heat waves, steer clear of sugary drinks, like sweet teas, lemonades, and sodas. Sugar increases thirst and raises body temperature, which can lead to heatstroke and dehydration. \n\n\u2022 Limit outdoor activities to early mornings or as the sun is going down. These are the coolest times of the day because outdoor temperatures will drop with the setting of sunshine. \n\n\u2022 Use cold water to spritz your face, wash your hands up to the wrists, and dip your feet up to the ankles. You could also drape a cold rag around your neck for up to 10 minutes at a time. Do this several times a day when you feel the hottest and most bothered. The quick splashes of cold water on these major pulse points will slightly lower your body temperature. \n\n\u2022 Eat cold fruits and vegetables that are dense in nutrients with high water content. Watermelons, mangoes, cucumbers, and grapes are delicious, nutritious, and perfect for helping your body's core temperature cool down by a couple of degrees with beneficial hydration.\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Every day he would walk near the river to start his workout. Running, lifting weights, push-ups, he would do it all. One day, though, he notices a small, black crystal traveling down the river. Curious, Texas jumped into the water, grabbed the crystal, and walked out. In his hand was the dark crystal, undamaged. The crystal looked as dark as the blackest night. For some reason, Texas was intrigued by it. It was like the crystal was pulling his gaze toward it. Texas places the crystal near the rest of his things and continues his workout. \"One, two, one, two,\" Texas told himself as he continued his workout, but he could not get the dark crystal out of his mind. He finished his workout and grabbed his things, including the dark crystal. Texas thought about where it came from as he examined the crystal. Suddenly, the crystal started to glow, and Texas threw the crystal back at the river. The crystal's glow started to fade away as it traveled back down the river. Something told Texas that he had just avoided a harrowing adventure. He got back on his feet and started walking back to his house. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Take time to prepare his favorite foods for dinner, then pack them up to have a second time at work the next day. \n\nIf cooking isn\u2019t your forte, or if your husband\u2019s favorite meal isn\u2019t something that\u2019s made at home, then buy it instead. Split the food at home into a lunch container for tonight and tomorrow. \n\n\u2022\tGive him a relaxing massage to help him sleep.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like being rubbed and relaxed until you doze off. Tell him to lie on his stomach and give him a head-to-toe rubdown that soothes his senses with scented lotions, like lavender or eucalyptus. \n\n\u2022\tInvest in things that will help him unwind and relax after a long day of work. \n\nYour husband has his favorite things that help him relax after a workday, so keep those stocked for when he comes home. For instance, his favorite after-work snacks and drinks could be signs of care and appreciation! \n\nAnother great investment for a hardworking husband is an ottoman. When he gets home and takes off his work boots, give him a comfy space where he can put his feet up and watch some television before bedtime. \n\n\u2022\tLeave sweet notes of appreciation and love in his lunchbox. \n\nWords matter. Show your husband that you care and appreciate all he does with surprise love notes in his lunchbox. They are fun to find and will give him a boost of romantic feelings for you! \n\n\u2022\tPlan a day that\u2019s all about him! \n\nWhat does your husband love to do? Bowling? Movies? Drinking good beer with good friends at the best bar in town? Treat him to his faves! Take him on a date for a whole day and include all of the things that he loves to do. \n\nWhen you two get home, let him dictate how the night goes. You can spend more time together or go your separate ways to focus on other hobbies and interests. \n \n\u2022\tAlways kiss him hello, goodbye, and goodnight! \n\nTouch and physical affection will always be the best go-to methods for showing your husband how much you care. \n\nWhen he comes home, kiss him to convey that you are happy to see him. Before he leaves for work, kiss him to wish him a good, safe workday. Before you go to sleep at night, kiss him to remind him that you love and cherish him.

After his peaceful seaside vacation had passed, Yuriko returned to his treehouse in Leaf Valley.\n\nYuriko rattled the key around in the lock on his front door.

He was very upset to find all of his stuff missing and was growing angry. His friend and the policeman reassured Yuriko that the culprit would be caught. The only information that the officer could provide about the suspect was that it was one of the local squirrels in the animal village.\n\nIn order to save up money for new furniture, Yuriko took on a couple of new pastimes. First, he expanded his carrot garden so that he could grow extra crops to sell at the market. Second of all, he\u2019s picked up fishing.

In fact, she doesn't even have any dirt or grime on her hands, despite claiming that she was helping Gus in the yard. She lied about doing any chores around the house because she didn't want to let her husband Mark know she was going out of the house to meet her secret lover at the motel down the street.\n\nGus was, however, in the yard diligently pulling weeds to ensure the grounds were kept clean and tidy before the arrival of our esteemed guests. This can be evidenced by the dirt Gus tracked from the yard, through the living room and into his bedroom. The tracks go across the threshold fronting the living room where the murder took place; the dirt remains undisturbed in this area, which means the killer did the deed before Gus entered the house as there is no dirt under the body. So he had to have been killed before Gus tracked in the dirt. No dirt was present in the living room, which means Gus is cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, one person had the opportunity, motive, and means to carry out the murder: Michael.\n\nMichael never leaves the house; he has agoraphobia. The fear and anxiety he felt when he was prodded by Mark to come outside for a drink, only to be criticized and bullied by Mark and the others for refusing, caused Michael's anxiety to turn into rage. All Michael had to do was wait inside the living room with his glass of wine and wait. The slash marks on Mark's neck are the telltale bluish-purple hue of Michael's favorite drink, blueberry wine.

But, since it seemed that you were quite excited about it, I decided I would give it a chance before deciding. \n\nHowever, since that time, it has been the worst house guest I have ever seen in my life! First of all, it pooped in the middle of the floor. I mean, come on. That should be reason enough. Where is its box? \n\nAnd as if that wasn\u2019t enough, it made the worst noise at the delivery man the other day. Screaming and shouting like a crazy person! \n\nPlus, it chases me all over the house! There isn\u2019t a safe place anymore. I\u2019ve taken to hiding up above the television unit or under your bed, but I can\u2019t live like that forever. \n\nSo here\u2019s the bottom line: It\u2019s me or the dog. Now, I know I\u2019m not perfect, but I have lived in your house for the past five years and have barely made a peep! I\u2019m calm, cuddly, and seriously sweet.

This time, instead of leaving me outside like usual, she brought me into the building with her. It smelled so good and people were sitting at all the tables, slowly drinking out of warm cups.\n\n\"Come here, Scruffy,\" my owner said.\n\nShe led me behind the counter and held up a harness. I sniffed it. It smelled strange, like the drink she always brought out with my doggy treat. With a smile, she pulled the harness over my head and fastened it in place. There were strange cup holders on either side of it, but she assured me that everything was alright, so I didn't worry.\n\n\"You're going to bring the customers their drinks and treats,\" my owner explained. She slipped two cups into the holders of my harness and pointed to a couple across the room. \"Go to them.\"\n\nI was wary but did as she said. As soon as they had their drinks, they gave me a doggy treat! When I returned to my owner, she gave me more drinks and pointed out a different person. He waved a doggy treat at me and I was off.

The bowler delivers the ball with speed through the air so that any movement through the air (in-swing, out-swing, reverse swing) or deviation of the pitch makes it difficult for the batsman to compensate in time.\n\nPace bowlers can:\n1. Change the pace of the delivery: even slight variations in pace can significantly increase the difficulty for a Batman.\n2. Swing the ball: competent bowlers can swing the ball in from left to right (in-swing); or out from right to left (outswing) or deploy reverse swing ( the ball moves in the opposite direction to expectations) using an older ball. \n3. Yorker: an ideal yorker is delivered at full length to bounce (pitch) under the bat (or foot line) of a Batman.\n4. Bouncer: these delivers are balled at high speeds to bounce in the first half of the pitch, which makes them rise steeply. This makes it difficult for the batsman to track the ball and they may resort to trying to evade it in order not to get hit in the chest or face.\n\nThere are countless other variations available to a pace baller.\n\nThe quickest pace bowlers bowl in the high 90mph range and express bowlers, like Shoaib Akhtar has bowled at 100.2mph.

I really want to install a pool in my yard. Can you tell me a bit about the different types of pools?","role":"user"},{"content":"Sure! Here are the different types of pools you might want to consider:\n\n1. Inground Pool: Inground pools are permanent structures built into the ground. They offer a wide range of design possibilities and can be customized in terms of shape, size, and materials.\n2. Above-Ground Pool: Above-ground pools are installed on top of the ground with a framework made of metal, resin, or wood. They are more affordable and easier to install compared to inground pools. \n3. Infinity Pool: Infinity pools, also known as vanishing-edge or negative-edge pools, create the illusion of the water extending to the horizon. They feature at least one edge that spills over into a catch basin, giving a seamless blend with the surrounding environment. They're expensive but popular due to their aesthetic appeal. \n4. Lap Pool: Lap pools are specifically designed for swimming laps and exercise. They're long and narrow, allowing swimmers to swim continuously without interruptions. Lap pools can be either inground or above ground, and they usually have a consistent depth throughout the pool.\n5. Swim Spa: A swim spa is a combination of a small pool and a spa. It features a powerful current that allows you to swim in place, providing the benefits of swimming and hydrotherapy. Swim spas are smaller than traditional pools, so they can fit more easily in your yard.\n6. Hot Tub: Hot tubs, also known as spas or jacuzzis, are small, heated pools designed for relaxation, hydrotherapy, and enjoyment. They often have built-in jets that provide massaging and therapeutic effects. Hot tubs can be either inground or above ground and are usually small.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

She was so very glad they were here with her, helping her pave the way toward her throne. Though one had been born into wealth and privilege and the other born into a second-class, pigeonholed status where people with her skin color rarely raised themselves out of struggling mightily every day to meet their basic needs, something bigger brought them to equal footing. It was grief. Loss. A year ago, after a battle with a slow but incurable illness, Naveen's mother lost the man she'd been married to for nearly 40 years. There seemed to be a quiet understanding between the two women, sisters in heartache. \nNot that is was so dark as all that. Upon learning of his father's illness, Tiana and Naveen did something she'd never imagined. They'd sold the restaurant, packed up their New Orleans home, and asked the nanny that looked after their two daughters to accompany them across the sea. The girls, Lottie and Elodie, were doing fine. They'd barely understood that they were princesses, and all this was a grand adventure. Tiana felt a pinch in her stomach anytime she looked at Lottie. Her oldest, her girl that now would grow to one day be queen. It was better than being barred from half of life in the bayou, but it was far from a normal life. \n\"You're worrying, darling,\" her mother said, pulling Tiana from her misgivings. \n\"This is Naveen's birthright dear, and I have a surprise for you,\" the queen said. \"Follow me.\" \nTiana followed the queen mother down the winding, tapestried stone walls of the castle. She'd never get used to how sprawling the palace was, how many rooms there were. This walk wasn't comforting her. \nThat was until the queen mother pulled open a door and said, \"Oh, I hope you like it!\" \n\"Oh,\" Tiana said at first, words beyond her. \nThere before her was a fully equipped, top-of-the-line kitchen. Every tool she could imagine and some she'd never laid eyes on before gleamed under the bright lights. Rolling pins stood sentinel beside marble slabs meant to evenly cool chocolate. And, best of all, in pride of place, stood a framed picture of her father. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Besides, her husband's sleepy face and the feeling of his muscular body against hers would make the past seem irrelevant, at least for the moment.  He has his own traumas to deal with, she would tell herself, though this was a contradictory thought because she relied as much on his solidity as he relied on her good taste.  She knew they could talk about anything, and yet... this one was tough.\n\nShe would dream of a house.  It was a bit like Nott-Cott, and a bit like Frogmore, but not really... there were elements of California in there too, but not current California - this was something from the 80s.  This house felt like a whole past life.  She found family heirlooms mixed with Dr. Seuss books, old trophies, and old fine arts posters you might find in the room of an aspirational teenager, plus some of her favorite high school clothing items in a high chest of drawers.  But there was a whole sector of the house she could not visit. She would not visit.  Evil lurked there.  She had a memory of having visited those rooms, and terror struck her heart.  \n\nEach time, she woke up winded.  Harry would take her in his arms and ask, \"Are you all right, my love?\" and she would say \"Yes.\"  This morning would be different.  It was 5 am, and the children were still asleep.  The house personnel was busily preparing the day's business downstairs, and Meghan would seize the moment.  They would have coffee in bed, and she would tell him all about it.

His back was wide like a pair of pork chops, and the muscles of his arms were like large gumdrops covered with a layer of fondant skin. His legs were also muscly and veiny, like a pair of thick licorice ropes under blueberry jeans.\n\nMarco was a happy-go-lucky fella who had the personality of a cool refreshing lime soda on a hot day and the reliability of a good old Snickers bar when one gets hungry. When Marco sits down to do work at his computer, his attention to detail is as awe-inspiring as a cake decorator making a three-tiered wedding cake.\n\nKate:\n\nKate had the skin of a pint of silky vanilla ice cream. Her lips were like cherries on top of the vanilla ice cream, while her hair was dark brown like that of hot fudge. Her facial appearance was that of a delicious hot fudge sundae, dotted with two almonds for eyes.\n\nKate was always cool as a cucumber and as solid as a jawbreaker. But she also had a nougaty soft spot for puppies. When she would get home from ordering sushi from the local restaurant, she would melt contentedly into her lounge chair as a snow cone melts into its cone-shaped cup.\n\nSierra:\n\nSierra had the appearance of a cool mocha drink from a vintage coffee shop. Her lithe frame was like a pretzel stick, and her hair was a whitish-blue hue like freshly spun cotton candy. Sierra was the bubbliest of the three of them, having a personality like that of a boba tea and the taste of sweet, tangy candy. \n\nBut where she was sweet in personality, she was also as bland and no-nonsense as a macaroni salad without the mayonnaise when it came to doing work. She liked the routine of work, and she made sure her work life mimicked that of molasses dripping from the top of a cinnamon bun: slow and steady.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Well, deafening was just a bit of an exaggeration, the ant learned, because it was nothing compared to the shrieking yelp the giant gave afterward. The other giant, a chocolate brown one, bared its teeth briefly. Then, it gave a huffing, defeated sigh through its nose, laying its head down on its massive, clawed feet. The puff of wind it sent pealed the ant's front legs off of the floor, making the tiny bug look like it was a bucking bronco with its antennae waving wildly from all the over-stimulation it was finding itself put through. \n\nWhat are these things? The ant wondered. Food? \n\nThe minuscule bug found itself pulled forward as if on a string. Instinct was driving the tiny ant at this point, one foot in front of the other, then another in front of the next until it found itself basked in the shadows of the two creatures. The yellow one was too wild to approach, and the ant felt torn at the realization. On one hand, the ant was a warrior. It had been through many a battle before and survived, through bravery and tactical retreat. On the other hand, the ant knew that its job was also to be a scout, to find food for the rest of the kingdom. And, most importantly, the queen. \n\nBut if the other ants back home found out about these two massive threats, wouldn't they be disappointed? Disgusted? It was their job to protect the queen, the babies. The nest itself. Without thinking, the ant opened up its pinchers wide and sank them into the endless expanse of dark, rough texture on the bottom of the yellow dog's foot. This was merely to secure itself. The real attack was only beginning. Before the dog could react, the ant began driving its stinger into the scratchy surface of the giant's paw pad, sinking it in and out, pumping the flesh full of venom.\n\nThen the giant lifted its paw, scraped it against the concrete, and the ant was snuffed out. Just like that. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

You got it. Here are five ways you can get involved in your community and make a difference:\n1. Volunteer. This is the most common and easiest way to get involved in your community to make a difference. You can volunteer your time to dog walk, or help in a retirement home. Just reach out to organizations that align with your values, and offer to help in any way you can.\n2. Look for local events. Find local events that are organized like dances that you can participate in, and join in to celebrate and enjoy the performances. Even your attendance will go a long way in supporting the artists.\n3. Support your local sports teams. Be it a local football league, a high school, or a college league, find a team from your local area participating in one of these leagues and join in during their matches to cheer them on. The players do love themselves some fans during these matches.\n4. Shop locally. There are several vendors and small businesses in your community selling different kinds of items and goodies. Be it paintings, jewelry, or other handmade crafts or grocery, buying from them will boost their business, and ensure their continuity. \n5. Donate your resources. Last but not least, donations from you can also be a good way to get involved in your community. Do you have much that you don't use? From oversized clothes to excess utensils, furniture, or just any stuff in the home. Give this to people who don't have, it and need them.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

After wasting $100 on this company, I'm not falling for their upselling tactic. What a coincidence that they recommend a large \"gaming\" mousepad.

Here are some tips on how to prepare for your upcoming trip:\n\n1. Make an itinerary - Write down exactly what you plan to do and when you plan to do it. Making an itinerary gives you an outline of the events that are to take place during your trip, as well as the amount of time you expect to spend doing each activity so you can see and do everything you want within a set time.\n2. Research - When deciding to take a cross-country trip, do your research into what activities you want to do, what sights you want to see, and where you want to go. Research what your mode(s) of transportation will be (rental car, train, bus, bike) for each step of the trip, and budget your time and money accordingly.\n3. Plan ahead - Traveling long distances requires planning to ensure the trip is enjoyable. This includes planning for situations that will arise, such as being hungry or thirsty, fatigue, and other issues. Consider bringing snacks, food, and water, or look for restaurants and rest stops along your planned route of travel. If traveling via rental car, make sure you know where the gas stations are along your route and ensure your gas tank is filled up for the long trip ahead. Bring spare articles of clothing in case the clothes you're wearing become dirty, and bring clothing that matches the environments you will be in, such as warm clothing for cold areas.\n4. Charge your phone - In case of an emergency, you will want to have a phone that is fully charged and capable of making calls for assistance. Also, having a fully charged phone will allow you to take photos that will memorialize your trip.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

{"prompt":"Write a summary of fewer than 150 words bout the article below.\n\nWilliam Congreve (1670-1729) was an English playwright, and one of the most sophisticated exponent of the comedy of manners during the Restoration era. Congreve wrote five plays before he was 30. His first, The Old Bachelor, was an enormous success at Drury Lane in 1693, in a production starring Thomas Betterton and Mrs Bracegirdle. According to Congreve he wrote the play to amuse himself during a convalescence.\n\nThe Double Dealer (1694) was not so well received but in 1695 he produced another hit, Love for Love (again with Betterton and Mrs Bracegirdle), to open the new Lincoln's Inns Fields Theatre. Its success secured his reputation and earned him a share in the theatre. His promise to write at least one play a year for the theatre of which he was now a part owner, was unfortunately not fulfilled. Congreve's only tragedy, The Mourning Bride (1697), was his most popular work during his lifetime but is now rarely seen. It starred Mrs Bracegirdle as Almeria, a part that became much coveted by tragic actresses.\n\nIn 1700 The Way of the World, - a highly sophisticated and complex work now considered his masterpiece - met with a cool reception. This failure, together with his continued discomfort at having been attacked in Jeremy Collier's influential pamphlet A Short View of the Profaneness and Immorality of the English Stage (1698), persuaded him to retire.

However, here are some arguments you can use:\n\n1. Friendliness: Cats can be said to be moody, and they don't always like a lot of attention. Dogs are almost always willing to have attention, and they love being played with. \n2. Trainability: While cats can be trained with enough patience, dogs are said to be more eager. There are many tricks that you can teach a dog. \n3. Variety: While there are varieties of cats to choose from, they are all pretty similar in size. There is much more variety when it comes to the size and temperament of the dog you can get. \n4. More Laughter: There have been studies done showing that dogs can make you laugh more than cats do. This might be because of their amusing head-tilting behavior or something else. Either way, laughter is good for you. \n5. More Accepting: People commonly dress up dogs, which happens less often with cats. \n6. Socialization: There are many places you can take your dog to, such as training classes, competitions, or even just dog parks. Each of these provides you a chance to get to make new friends with other dog owners.\n7. Encourage Responsibility: Dogs require much more responsibility than cats, as they need to go outside, be exercised, bathed, etc. Though this does mean there is more work for them, it also means they are better at teaching responsibility. \n8. Encourage Exercising: As part of the added responsibility of having a dog, you will also get daily exercise by taking them for a walk or even just taking them outside so they can use the restroom. \n9. Protection: Dogs will bark when someone is coming and can alert you of danger. \n10. Loyalty: Dogs are said to be much more loyal than cats. \n\nThese are just a few potential arguments in favor of dogs. I hope this helps!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

{"prompt":"Hello. What are the key points of how cars are getting more fuel efficient in the following article? Summarize this in about 2 sentences per paragraph for me, please.\n\nA big factor in fuel efficiency is the type of fuel that cars use. While you may be used to premium, regular, and diesel, you may have noticed the sticker at your local gas station that says that 10% of the gasoline you\u2019re purchasing is ethanol. Ethanol is a type of fuel made from corn that can be burned in a regular combustion engine without producing the harmful pollution that gasoline is known for. While ethanol may not bring the price of gas down much, it does burn better than gasoline, at least to some extent, and has contributed to better fuel efficiency in modern vehicles.\n\nAnyone who owns a hybrid car can understand how much gas can be saved by switching to an electric motor. While vehicles that depend completely on an electric motor aren\u2019t very powerful and need to be recharged regularly, a hybrid vehicle that combines the efficiency of an electric motor with the raw power produced by a combustion engine can save drivers a ton of gas without a significant loss in performance.\n\nAnother way that cars are becoming more fuel efficient has to do with how cars are being built. While older vehicles were made of steel, newer vehicles are made of aluminum, fiber glass, and even ceramic materials. By reducing the total amount of weight that a combustion engine or hybrid motor has to move, newer vehicles are able to get better gas mileage and tend to have more reliable engines.","prompt_id":"d4df9325502f4ad29b152db6eda07919a870d2cecaa069ec03c20e8832632e1b","messages":[{"content":"Hello.

In the event of a future supply shortage, these will also be among the first items to disappear off the shelves, so stockpiling any kind of cleaning items now while you still can will be wise. \n\nPeanut Butter - Peanut butter is a wise item to stockpile (so long as you don't have a peanut allergy) because of the wide variety of meals and dishes it can be included in. Furthermore, peanut butter can provide a good source of protein for those who are on vegetarian diets. \n\nPet Food - Do you have any pets, such as dogs or cats? If so, stock up on as much pet food for them now while you still can. People care deeply about their animals, so you can bet that pet food will fly off the shelves fast in the event of a major disruption to the supply chains. \n\nWater Purification Tablets - Water purification tablets are critical for ensuring that the water you collect is made safe to drink. What's more, you can usually buy hundreds of tablets for super cheap. \n\nCan Openers - Have you stockpiled any canned food? If so, you'll want to start stockpiling a few can openers as well.

If the module name is accurate, the most likely cause of a ModuleNotFoundError is that you have the wrong version of PIP installed and cannot import the package. There are a few things you can do to fix this:\n\n1. Ensure PIP is properly installed on your computer. Search for `pip3.exe` in your files. If it is not found, you can reinstall Python and check the box \"Add Python 3.6 to PATH\" during installation.\n\n2. In the command shell, enter `python -m pip`. This will configure the PIP installer to the version of Python your interpreter uses.\n\n3. Check that the module is compatible with your Python version. You can look up the module and see which versions of Python are supported, then enter the following script in the command shell to check if your version is compatible:\n`import sys`\n`sys. version`\n\nLet me know if these troubleshooting tips don't work and I can look for other options.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Coding"}

However, when pizza was involved, the atmosphere in their apartment changed. There were no friendly ribs and remarks, and their eyes were not kind to each other. This wasn't about starvation; the apartment had plenty of good food available, from sandwiches to soups. But to both of them, this was about principle. They bought their weekly pizza and began to idly take slices, enjoying it immensely. But when it came down to the last slice, they crowded around the box and stared each other down.\n\n\"Thinking of taking the last slice, are we?\" James said in an accusatory tone. He knowingly placed his hand close to the box, as if making clear his challenge.\n\n\"Yes, I was. We wouldn't want the pizza to go to waste, would we?\" Patrick responded icily, as he responded by placing both hands on the table close to the box, one-upping James' gesture. \n\nThe two stared daggers at each other, and they began to circle the box of pizza like predators who had cornered their prey. This would go on for at least ten minutes, and with each minute their stress and intensity grew, as they knew the pizza would not stay fresh and warm for too long. Stopping just behind the box, James gave a quick sigh, before wearing a false smile.\n\n\"Patrick. Certainly, you don't mind if I take the last slice?

Many drink mixes help you absorb water better or improve the taste of your water by incorporating electrolytes.\n4. Filter your water. Many people don't like water straight from the tap.

Practice meditation: Meditation is known to encourage a person to slow down and pay more attention to their surroundings rather than being absorbed in their thoughts. A simple way to meditate is by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position and then observing your thoughts as they come and go. Rather than engaging with the thoughts - just allow them to flow in and drift away. This can take some practice, and it's normal to find it tricky at first, but it is very effective for becoming more present. \n\n2. Engage your senses: Our mind is a great tool that allows us to solve problems and be creative, but we also have other ways of experiencing the world around us. Our senses can be a great portal into the present moment, as they help us to shift our focus out of our minds. To do this, you can try asking yourself questions such as: \"How does my clothing feel on my body?\" or \"What sounds can I hear in the distance?\"\n\n3. Take a break from social media:  When you're scrolling through your feed on social media, you're constantly either thinking about the past or the future. The videos and photos on these platforms are all from the past, which makes it hard to be present. Pausing social media usage and instead using tools like a mindfulness journal will make it easier to shift your focus to the present moment rather than being constantly distracted. \n\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

They will inevitably make you happier by giving you the warmest cuddles and being your closest companion. Your French Bulldog\u2019s happiness matters just as much as your happiness, which begs the question: how do you make sure that you are making your French Bulldog as happy as they make you?\n\nPetting Your French Bulldog\nHappy French Bulldogs will lean into you or nudge you when you pet them, which is one of the best ways for them to show you how happy and healthy they are. When your Frenchie is happy, they naturally enjoy constant attention and stimulation.\n\nExercise \nFrench Bulldogs are happy when you take the time to exercise with them. It\u2019s good for your Frenchie to perform physical activity regularly because they will feel energized and healthier. When exercising, your French Bulldog will be happiest if you go on a short walk or play with them.\n\nPlay Games \nFrench Bulldogs love to play games as they are among the most playful breeds of dogs. Find a game that your Frenchie can enjoy, like fetching sticks and balls, chewing up their favorite chew toy, chasing after the light made by a laser pen, and playing tug-of-war. These games you play with your Frenchie will help you bond with them and provide them with fun, stimulating activities.\n\nSocialization\nAn amazing fact about French Bulldogs is that they are happier when they have another Frenchie to bond with, so if you can raise two Frenchies, go for it! If that isn\u2019t possible for you, take your Frenchie to doggie daycare to make sure they have some doggy friends.\n\nGet Their Favorite Foods\nFrench Bulldogs are foodies! They will be happy when you present them with their favorite foods in their food bowls or by hand. As long as you make sure they have a nutritional and tasty diet, they will be healthy and happy because, as a rule, happy French Bulldogs love to eat.\n\nAre you a dog mom or dad with a French Bulldog that loves taking care of your French Bulldog so that you can see a happy smile on their face every day?

I ask for your guidance and understanding as I prepare for my long overdue retirement from the most fulfilling career I can imagine, and I must say, I have quite the imagination. Teaching in your school district, and educating the children of your community for the last 598 years, I could ask for no higher honor. I realize that my departure may be a shock to some of you, but rest assured, I have not made this decision lightly.\n\nI shall begin with the obvious, for clarity's sake. I am not what you would call an ordinary teacher. I am a timeless and magical genie. Throughout my tenure here at Abarra-Kadaabra, I have been so lucky to work with hundreds, nay, thousands of bright educators and students alike. I made it a rule to always provide the absolute best learning environment I was able to conjure, offering guidance and wisdom to any who sought it. I have also granted innumerable wishes, well beyond the scope of an average genie. As you know, I strived to never let my true identity or my magical powers get in the way of learning. As you might imagine, however, almost 600 years is quite a long time, several lifetimes, it often seems.\n\nI am beyond thankful for the experience of teaching and working in your district for all this time, and I hope I am remembered as fondly. I ask that you would please guide me in the steps I must take for a seamless transition to what comes next, in order to carry on the excellence we have fostered here.\n\nI cannot thank you enough. Bless you all. Learning is the only magic the world will ever need.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

{"prompt":"Rewrite the article with comedic twist.\n\nMosquitoes bite, suck your blood, and leave you with itchy bumps and possibly a horrible infection. Mosquito-borne pathogens include malaria, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and dengue.\n\nWhile you might fantasize about living in a mosquito-free world, eradicating them would actually be disastrous for the environment. Adult mosquitoes are food for other insects, birds, and bats, while larval mosquitoes support aquatic ecosystems. The best we can hope for is to limit their ability to transmit disease, repel them, and kill them within the confines of our yards and homes.\n\nMosquito-killing products bring in the big bucks, so it should come as no surprise that there is a wealth of misinformation out there. Before you get sucked into buying a product that simply won't work, get educated about what does and does not kill these blood-sucking pests.\n\nFirst, you need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and killing them. Repellents make a location (like your yard or skin) less attractive to mosquitoes, but don't kill them. So, citronella, DEET, smoke, lemon eucalyptus, lavender, and tea tree oil might keep the insects at bay, but won't control them or get rid of them in the long run. Repellents vary in effectiveness, too. For example, while citronella may deter mosquitoes from entering a small, enclosed area, it doesn't really work in a wide open space (like your back yard).\n\nThere are a host of methods that actually do kill mosquitoes, but aren't great solutions. A classic example is a bug zapper, which kills only a few mosquitoes, yet attracts and kills beneficial insects that keep the mozzy population down. Similarly, spraying pesticides is not an ideal solution because mosquitoes can become resistant to them, other animals get poisoned, and the toxins can cause lasting environmental damage.\n\nMany species of mosquitoes required standing water to breed, so one of the most effective methods of controlling them is to remove open containers and repair leaks. Dumping containers of standing water kills the larvae living in them before they get a chance to mature.\n\nHowever, removing water may be undesirable or impractical in some cases. Further, some species don't even need standing water to reproduce! The Aedes species, responsible for transmitting Zika and dengue, lays eggs out of water. These eggs remain viable for months, ready to hatch when sufficient water becomes available.\nA better solution is to introduce predators that eat immature or adult mosquitoes or infectious agents that harm mosquitoes without affecting other wildlife.\n\nMost ornamental fish consume mosquito larvae, including koi and minnows. Lizards, geckos, dragonfly adults and naiads, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans all eat mosquitoes.\n\nAdult mosquitoes are susceptible to infection by the fungi Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauveria bassiana. A more practical infectious agent is the spores of the soil bacterium Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis (BTI),. Infection with BTI makes the larvae unable to eat, causing them to die. BTI pellets are readily available at home and gardening stores, easy to use (simply add them to standing water), and only affect mosquitoes, black flies, and fungus gnats. The treated water remains safe for pets and wild animals to drink. The disadvantages of BTI are that it requires reapplication every week or two and it doesn't kill adult mosquitos.\nThere are several chemical methods that target mosquitoes without the risks to other animals that come with spraying pesticides.\n\nSome methods rely on chemical attractants to lure mosquitoes to their doom. Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide, sugary scents, heat, lactic acid, and octenal. Gravid females (those carrying eggs) may be attracted to traps laced with a hormone released during the egg-laying process.\n\nThe lethal ovitrap is dark, water-filled container, typically with a small opening to prevent larger animals from drinking the water. Some traps use chemicals to bait the traps, while others simply provide a convenient breeding ground. The traps may be filled with predators (e.g., fish) or with dilute pesticide to kill larvae (larvicide) and sometimes adults. These traps are highly effective and affordable. The disadvantage is that multiple traps must be used to cover an area (about one every 25 feet).\n\nAnother chemical method is the use of an insect growth regulator (IGR), added to water to inhibit larval development. The most common IGR is methoprene, which is supplied as a time-release brick. While effective, methoprene has been shown to be mildly toxic to other animals. \n\nAdding a layer of oil or kerosene to water kills mosquito larvae and also prevents females from depositing eggs. The layer alters the surface tension of the water. Larvae can't get their breathing tube to the surface for air, so they suffocate. However, this method kills other animals in the water and makes the water unfit for consumption.\nOne example of a physical method of killing mosquitoes is swatting them with your hand, a fly-swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works if you've only got a few mosquitoes, but it's not particularly helpful if you're being swarmed. While bug zappers aren't ideal outdoors because they can unnecessarily kill beneficial insects, electrocuting indoor insects isn't generally considered objectionable. Just remember, you need to bait a bug zapper to attract mosquitoes, because they don't care about the pretty blue light.\n\nBecause mosquitoes are not strong fliers, it's also easy to suck them onto a screen or into a separate trap using a fan. Mosquitoes caught using a fan die from dehydration. Screen-traps may be made at home by fastening window screening fabric over the back of a fan.","prompt_id":"da4403b6d03c77120c44a63ab1629fda74ec6f32e9789f776c41866a40428065","messages":[{"content":"Rewrite the article with comedic twist.\n\nMosquitoes bite, suck your blood, and leave you with itchy bumps and possibly a horrible infection.

What a delight! We all dream of a world free from these buzzing nuisances, but believe it or not, getting rid of them would be a total disaster for the environment.\n\nYou see, adult mosquitoes are like fast food for other insects, birds, and bats. They're the all-you-can-eat buffet for the insect world! And let's not forget about the larval mosquitoes. They play a crucial role in supporting aquatic ecosystems. So, as much as we despise them, the best we can do is limit their disease-spreading abilities, repel them, and kill them within the comfort of our yards and home.\n\nNow, brace yourself, because mosquito-killing products are a gold mine. And where there's money to be made, there's bound to be a plethora of misinformation. Don't fall victim to the charade of useless products! It's time to get educated on what works against these bloodthirsty critters.\n\nFirst things first, we need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and straight-up obliterating them. Repellants, like citronella, DEET, and all those fancy-sounding oils, make your location [like your yard or your skin] less enticing to mosquitoes. But let's get real here, they won't kill the little buggers or solve the problem in the long run. It's like trying to keep your annoying neighbour at bay with a strongly scented candle. It might work for a while, but eventually, they'll come back, uninvited and ready to ruin your evening.\n\nNow, for methods that claim to kill mosquitoes. Brace yourselves for disappointment because they aren't all that great.  Take big zappers, for example. Sure, they'll fry a few mosquitoes, but they'll also take down some beneficial insects that help keep the mosquito population in check. Oops, collateral damage.\n\nAnd let's not forget about spraying pesticides. Sure, it sounds like a solid plan, but mosquitoes can quickly become resistant to these chemicals, Plus, another innocent creature ends up getting poisoned, and the long-term environmental damage is no joke. So, unless you're aiming to create a mutant army of super mosquitoes, let's skip the pesticide party. \n\nNow, here's a tip that actually works. Many mosquitoes breed in standing water, so removing open containers and fixing leaks is an effective way to control them. It's like hitting the nursery where it hurts! Dumping the water-filled mosquito cribs kills the larvae before they have the chance to mature and ruin your summer nights.\n\nBut it isn't always that simple. Some mosquitoes are so crafty that they don't even need standing water to reproduce. Take the Aedes species, responsible for Zika and dengue, for example. These little troublemakers lay eggs outside of water, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to hatch. They're like spy agents of the mosquito world.\n\nSo, what can we do? Well, how about unleashing the power of nature? Introduce predators that feast on immature or adult mosquitoes. We're talking about lizards, geckos, dragonflies, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans. It's like assembling a superhero team to battle the forces of evil [or in this case, itchy bumps and diseases.\n\nWe can infect those bloodsuckers with fungi, bacteria, and other agents that make them regret ever messing with us. For example, adult mosquitoes can fall victim to fungi like Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauverua bassiana. Talk about a fungal infection they'll never forget! and if you prefer something more practical, try infecting them with Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis [BTI], a bacterium that ruins their appetite and leads them to demise. It's like serving them a deadly dinner they won't be able to resist.\n\nNow, let's talk about chemical warfare against mosquitoes, minus the risks to other innocent critters. Some clever methods use chemical attractants to lure mosquitos to their demise. It's like setting up a mosquito trap disguised as a five-star restaurant, complete with irresistible delicacies. \n\nAnd have you heard of lethal ovitrap? It's like a mosquito nightclub that no female mosquito can resist. It's a dark, water-filled container with a small opening to keep out party crashers. Some traps use chemicals as bait, while others provide the perfect breeding ground. You can invite predators or add a dash of pesticide to the mix. Talk about throwing wild party mosquitoes will regret attending!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We have the insect growth regulator [IGR], a chemical that ruins the larvae' development. It's like giving them a taste of the \"you shall not grow' potion. However, we must admit, it has a slight downside- it's mildly toxic to other creatures. \nOops!\n\nNow, here's a method that's straight out of a slapstick comedy. Get ready to swat those bloodsuckers with your bare hands, a fly swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works like magic when you're dealing with just a few mosquitoes. But if you're facing a full-on mosquito invasion, well good luck with that! It's like trying to fight an army of tiny vampires armed with a rolled-up newspaper. Let's just say the odds aren't in your favour.\n\nOh, and did I mention that mosquitoes aren't the brightest when it comes to flying? That's right! You can easily suck them onto a screen or a trap using a fan. It's like the ultimate mosquito vortex! Those suckers caught in the wind will meet their demise due to dehydration. As for the screen traps, you can create your very own DIY version by attracting window screen fabric to the back of a fan. It's like setting up a mosquito-themed escape room, with no escape in sight.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! The hilarious battle against mosquitoes. Remember, these bloodsuckers may be annoying, but they provide a buffet for other insects and support aquatic ecosystems. Our best bet is to repel them, limit their disease transmission, and maybe unleash a few predators or infect them with a touch of nature's wrath. And if all else fails, well, at least you can enjoy a good laugh while swatting them away with a fly swatter or watching them get trapped in your DIY fan-powered vortex. Good luck, mosquito warriors!\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

{"prompt":"Give me a bulleted list of the causes of the Hundred Years\u2019 War from this article:\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the crisis of 14th-century Europe. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory; the official pretext was the question that arose because of the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French (Norman, and later, Angevin) in origin because of William the Conqueror, the Norman duke who became King of England in 1066. English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English.\nIn 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son by the rule of proximity of blood, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess.

The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory; the official pretext was the question that arose because of the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French (Norman, and later, Angevin) in origin because of William the Conqueror, the Norman duke who became King of England in 1066. English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English.\nIn 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son by the rule of proximity of blood, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess. An assembly of French barons decided that a native Frenchman should receive the crown, rather than Edward.[2]\nSo the throne passed instead to Charles's patrilineal cousin, Philip, Count of Valois. Edward protested but ultimately submitted and did homage for Gascony. Further French disagreements with Edward induced Philip, during May 1337, to meet with his Great Council in Paris.

I am interested in apps that offer cash back. ","role":"user"},{"content":"Here are some suggestions for shopping apps that offer cash back. \n\n1. DollarSprout Rewards - DollarSprout Rewards can be installed on your desktop browser as an extension. It works by automatically recognizing when you are about to purchase from a participating merchant such as Walgreens, Walmart, or Old Navy, and it prompts you to claim your cashback reward. Once you accumulate $5 in earnings after any amount of time, they pay out through the user's PayPal account the following month. \n\n2. Capital One Shopping - Capital One Shopping is an online browser extension as well as an app that applies coupons every time you check out. It lets you earn credits for shopping locally and informs you when there's a better price from another retailer. Users also have the option to add items to their Capital One Shopping watchlist so they can track prices and be notified when there's a better deal out there for them. \n\n3. Dosh - This cashback shopping app rewards you with everyday shopping both online and in-store. All you have to do is link your card to the app once and then enjoy the cash-back benefits over time as you shop. The great thing about the app is that it doesn't control or pressure you into making purchases you don't need simply because something is on sale. \n\n4. Rakuten - This popular shopping app issues cash back for shopping at popular online stores and a few local stores as well. Shopping on Rakuten is easy and you can do it both on the dedicated app or on your home computer. All you have to do to get started is open the Rakuten app on your phone and search the store of your choice using the search bar. Then click on any referral link to visit the store of your choosing and go about your normal shopping activities. \n\n5. Drop - Drop is an app that is similar to Rakuten which issues cash back for purchases made through qualifying links. The main difference is that Drop will pay you back in gift cards instead of in cash. But if you like the idea of gaining credits toward gift cards to your favorite stores then this would be a great option for you. After you accumulate 5,000 points on Drop, you can redeem them for a $5 gift card of your choice. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

What was it for?","role":"user"},{"content":"It was a prototype aircraft intended to fill the airborne warning and control system (AWACS) role for the Soviet Union to serve the needs of their fighter-bombers and attack aircraft. Three prototypes were built, but the planes never entered active service. \n\nThe An-71 was based on the Antonov An-72 cargo plane. That type had high-mounted jet engines because it was built for short takeoffs and landings on imperfect runways in austere locations. Placing the engines up high made them less likely to suck debris off the ground and damage the turbine blades.\n\nWhen it came time to modify that design to carry a large 360-degree radar system, designers decided to try integrating it into the tail fin rather than placing the round radome on an extra set of mounting brackets. Any feature that you place in the way of airflow creates drag, so eliminating the need for extra uprights would improve the plane\u2019s handling and range. \n\nEngineers couldn\u2019t just put the radome on the standard tail, though. The radar equipment is heavy and alters the plane\u2019s aerodynamics. Sweeping the tail forward placed the radome closer to the plane\u2019s center of gravity and thus improved its stability. It was considered a major redesign of the tail section (the horizontal stabilizers also had to be repositioned).\n\nAntonov briefly considered creating a naval version of the An-71 as well, but it quickly became apparent that adapting it for carrier operations would demand too many redesigned features. That project was scrapped.\n\nThe An-71 never entered service in part because of problems developing the radar itself. Its death knell, though, was the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Here are some with noted health benefits:\n\n\u2022 Mint: Mint's powerful smell can help combat any undesirable coup fumes and also keep insects at bay. In addition, it can encourage new feather growth in chickens and has been said to have a calming effect. (Calmer hens equals more eggs!) It can even be served fresh, frozen, or dried, and obviously has many household uses, as well. Because mint is a prolific grower, it's safe to plant near the coup. If it spreads inside, the chickens can trim the excess without harming the overall supply.\n\n\u2022 Lavender: Lavender is calming for chickens and humans alike! In addition, it has a lovely smell that mixes well with mint and other herbs. This smell helps dispel pests. Lavender is also good for the circulatory system, increasing blood flow when hens might not be moving around as much (during winter, cold snaps, or when sitting on eggs.) The seed-shaped flowers of lavender are also enjoyable for chickens to forage, providing some mental exercise.\n\n\u2022 Oregano: Oregano's smell deters pests and mixes wonderfully with the basil and tomatoes in your garden (which chickens also love!) Oregano grows best when harvested often, so whole springs can be hung in your coup for the chickens to pick at and scavenge. It's a natural antibiotic that's full of vitamins and antioxidants. You can even add dried oregano into your feed for these benefits, although it won't be as potent as fresh sprigs. \n\n\u2022 Thyme: Thyme, like the others, is aromatic and mixes wonderfully with the smell of lavender. (Just check your soap scents!) Like oregano, thyme is a natural antibiotic that also aids in respiratory stability. Thyme spreads, like mint, so it's safe to plant near the coup and let the chickens control the excess. It can be hung in full sprigs like oregano or dried. \n\nAdditionally, any of these herbs can be soaked in vinegar and used as an all-natural pest control due to their aromatics.

'New York, New York' by Frank Sinatra - This ode to Manhattan is a timeless classic full of optimism and bravado. It's sure to put your passengers in a great mood.\n2. 'Viva Las Vegas' by Elvis Presley - You may find it difficult to resist making a pit stop in Sin City after listening to this tune.\n3. 'Route 66' by the Rolling Stones - This legendary anthem to one of the most widely recognizable roads in America is sure to be a hit with your friends.\n4. 'Sweet Home Alabama' by Lynryrd Skynyrd - This song is chock-full of love for the state of Alabama. It has an opening riff that people will recognize right away and a chorus that's perfect for belting out at the top of your lungs with the windows rolled down.\n5. 'No Particular Place to Go' by Chuck Berry - While your road trip may indeed have a particular destination, the lyrics of this song are an ode to the joy of driving for fun. With its catchy riffs and infectious rhythm, you might find yourself rocking out behind the wheel while playing this tune. \n6. 'Georgia on My Mind' by Ray Charles - Ray Charles put a spin on this classic 1930 tune, making it at once a loving ode and a mournful ballad about his home state.\n7. 'Do You Know the Way to San Jose' by Dionne Warwick - This song is catchy but also calming, a great choice for early morning or late night driving.\n8. 'Fast Car' by Tracy Chapman - The lyrics of this song use traveling as a metaphor for escaping the past and heading towards a brighter future. With its calm, bluesy rhythm, it's also a great choice for a relaxing stretch of empty road. \n9. 'Dirty Water' by the Standells - This song is often played at Red Sox games as a classic ode to Boston. While the lyrics describe some of the city's less savory qualities, with the 'dirty water' standing as a reference to the polluted River Charles and Boston Harbor, the song is widely recognized as a prideful anthem with the chorus repeating, \"Oh Boston, you're my home.\"\n10. 'Drive My Car' by the Beatles - This is a great tune to sing along to, especially in the parts where the lyrics mimic car horns and other traffic sounds.\n11. 'California Girls' by the Beach Boys - This is a great song to blast at high volume while approaching the western coastline. The lyrics extoll the virtues of women from all over the country, not just California.\n12. 'Chicago' by Sufjan Stevens - You might think this song is about the city of Chicago based on its title, but the lyrics tell a story about driving all over the country, letting go of the past, and growing up.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Here are five reasons why we should go visit. \n1. Yellowstone National Park. The world's oldest national park has geysers and wildlife like bison. There are waterfalls, hot springs, and mud pots that were formed millions of years ago. This is where Old Faithful, the famous geyser is located. We can drive through the park, or we can hike it. We could also stay at one of the campgrounds. \n2. Jackson. This city is the entrance to the stunning Yellowstone National Park. We can visit the National Museum of Art where there are thousands of paintings, and in the winter ride a horse-drawn sleigh, and visit some restaurants for a taste of the wild west. \n3. The Cody Firearms Museum and Draper Museum of Natural History. We can see a huge assortment of firearms from around the world and look at all kinds of rocks at these museums! We can learn all about the original inhabitants of the area at the Plains Indian Museum.\n4. Cheyenne, the capital of Wyoming. This city was named after the Cheyenne Indians and once was a post of the U.S. Cavalry. If we visit in July we can go to the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo and see one of the best in the country.\n5. The Wind River Range. This area is one of the most lush and scenic places with snow-capped mountains, fields with flowers, and fish-filled rivers.

If so, you have a leak and are wasting many gallons of water a day.\n\n2. Stop unnecessary flushing. Make sure you're not in the habit of using your toilet as a trash can. Put tissues and small, flushable things in the trash can whenever possible to avoid unnecessary flushing of the toilet.\n\n3. Put a plastic bottle in your toilet tank. Put a few marbles or pebbles into a 1-quart bottle to weigh it down, and fill the rest with water. Place this inside your toilet tank. This will cause your toilet to use less water.\n\n4. Take shorter showers. Pay attention to how long your showers are, and if you prefer showers over water-saving baths, try to limit how long they are.\n\n5. Install water restrictors. Find water-saving shower heads and flow restrictors and install them. They are easy to install and will lower the amount of water you use.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Here are some creative ways in which you can use eggshells at home:\n1. Use the eggshells to start a small indoor seedling garden. You can use an eggshell as a growing container indoors, planting in the seedling, waiting for it to germinate and grow, and then transplanting it to an outdoor garden. It will save you on planting container costs and will be a source of calcium for the plant.\n2. Garden mulch. Crush the eggshells and then carry them straight out into the garden to mulch. On decomposition, they'll aerate the soil and provide essential calcium to the soil.\n3. Feed the eggshells to your chicken. Calcium-deficient chickens resort to eating their eggs to get the nutrients they need. To avoid this, crush up the eggshells that you have, bake them at 275 degrees, crush them even further, then feed them to the chickens.\n4. Use them to deter pests. You can also use crushed eggshells as protectors against slugs and snails. Just put them around the base of the plants to deter the pests from devouring your lovely greens.\n5. Add them to the compost. Improve the quality of your compost by adding egg shells. They are a great source of calcium and will make it so good for your garden.\n6. Wild bird food. Crush, bake, and then crush the eggshells again and feed them to the wild birds. Sprinkle them in the feed mix of the wild birds, or just put them on the ground for them to find.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Does the rogue open the door? Well, not that time, but they can just try again, right? Do they hear anything on the other side? Maybe not yet, but more time could reveal something. They have all the time in the world, right?\n\nIf you're rolling for a random encounter each round, they may not have all that much time to work with. If the rogue doesn't open the door, they might have to contend with a wandering monster. The possibility of an additional threat adds weight to every die roll, decision, and delay. There are other ways to do this, of course. Some GMs let the roll stand and don't allow retries. Some allow only those characters who are skilled in a task to perform it, and if they fail, that's it. But those usually require hard rulings on the part of the DM.\n\nUsing random encounters is a very natural way to create tension and make every failed die roll matter. In this article, we'll dive into exactly how random encounters accomplish this. It all comes down to encouraging players to make decisions on how much time they really want to spend rolling the dice on a given task.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

She often misses out on parties and spending time with friends. At school, everyone knows she is the oldest in the grade, and it's weird how everyone knows that or cares. It's just a number. Why there are random rankings at school, she fails to find a reasonable answer.\n\nWhen angry, which seems to be often, her cheeks become bright red.

Everyone is aware of The Temper of Maggie Brown and tries not to provoke her, except for certain people at school who enjoy poking the bear and getting her mad. Maggie is aware of her temper and scares herself sometimes with the force of her rage, though she will never admit it in front of anyone. Life has dragged her along, and her lack of freedom has made her into a caged animal.\n\nDespite her well-known temper, she is still a nice person overall. Her friends keep an eye out for signs of The Temper and try to either steer her in another direction, distract her, or help her through the feelings. She has good friends. Maggie knows this and is grateful. She wishes she could spend more time with them, but she is always busy at home.

{"prompt":"Make this brief history of ice cream even briefer by reducing it to exactly 150 words by using only the most basic information within it.\n\nBrief History of Ice Cream\nFirst ice creams appeared in ancient Persia, some 2500 years ago, and in those early times they were all based on the sweetened water that was iced, grinded into little pieces and then decorated with various tasting toppings and fruits. This tradition of ice cream production slowly reached Greek and Roman empires, where ice creams were welcomed with opened hands and used liberally by Roman nobility and royalty who had necessary money to fund very expensive process of production. Sadly, after the fall of the Roman Empire, organized ice transport from mountains to the cities below stopped, and ice cream continued to be even more expensive product. Little changed in the 1000 years following the fall of Rome, and only after the Europe started exiting Dark Ages did ice cream managed to resurface in Renaissance Italy.\nDuring 13th and 14th century, Italy was center of the trade with the Middle East and Asia, and their contact with new and innovative recipes of ice cream enabled this summertime treat to slowly spread across entire Europe. This expansion of ice cream was not an easy one, and it happened only after Italian noblewoman Catherine de'Medici went to France to marry Duke de Orleans (future king of France) in 1533. There she introduced nobility of continental Europe with the wonders of the east \u2013 eating utensils, high heeled shoes and off course, ice cream.

This tradition of ice cream production slowly reached Greek and Roman empires, where ice creams were welcomed with opened hands and used liberally by Roman nobility and royalty who had necessary money to fund very expensive process of production. Sadly, after the fall of the Roman Empire, organized ice transport from mountains to the cities below stopped, and ice cream continued to be even more expensive product. Little changed in the 1000 years following the fall of Rome, and only after the Europe started exiting Dark Ages did ice cream managed to resurface in Renaissance Italy.\nDuring 13th and 14th century, Italy was center of the trade with the Middle East and Asia, and their contact with new and innovative recipes of ice cream enabled this summertime treat to slowly spread across entire Europe. This expansion of ice cream was not an easy one, and it happened only after Italian noblewoman Catherine de'Medici went to France to marry Duke de Orleans (future king of France) in 1533. There she introduced nobility of continental Europe with the wonders of the east \u2013 eating utensils, high heeled shoes and off course, ice cream.

{"prompt":"Summarize the use of the pilum in the battle of Pharsalus\n\nIn 48 BC, Pompey the Great attempted to use it against Julius Caesar at the Battle of Pharsalus, in what was to be the decisive battle of the Great Roman Civil War. Caesar countered this by ambushing Pompey's \"hammer\" element with a hidden fourth line of infantry;[5] Pompey's infantry was to be the anvil while his cavalry 'hammer' encircled Caesar's left flank. There was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar.[6]\nAs the infantry of Caesar advanced, Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters; Pompey's adviser Gaius Triarius believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also, stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against pila throws.[7] Seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's infantry under Mark Antony and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus started the advance. As Caesar's men neared throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge;[8] Pompey's right and centre line held as the two armies collided. Caesar countered this by positioning the reserves of his 4th line to intercept the attacking cavalry.\nAs Pompey's infantry fought, Labienus ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar's cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar's cavalry.

Caesar countered this by ambushing Pompey's \"hammer\" element with a hidden fourth line of infantry;[5] Pompey's infantry was to be the anvil while his cavalry 'hammer' encircled Caesar's left flank. There was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar.[6]\nAs the infantry of Caesar advanced, Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters; Pompey's adviser Gaius Triarius believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also, stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against pila throws.[7] Seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's infantry under Mark Antony and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus started the advance. As Caesar's men neared throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge;[8] Pompey's right and centre line held as the two armies collided. Caesar countered this by positioning the reserves of his 4th line to intercept the attacking cavalry.\nAs Pompey's infantry fought, Labienus ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar's cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar's cavalry.

It is away from the more congested routes of travel, and its unpretentious, unimposing structure means that it is often missed as foodies flock to the more trendy and glitzy locations closer to the beach. Don't let that stop you from enjoying an authentic Medditarriean dining experience. You can still feel the salty breeze from the ocean air as you sit on the covered patio draped with well-established grape vines to shade the intimate atmosphere. The staff is knowledgeable about which wines to pair with your meals and appetizers. True to the European dining experience, you never feel rushed through your meal to make room for other patrons. It is the perfect way to spend a leisurely afternoon. The grape leaves were bright and tangy, with a fresh lemon flavor that is unparalleled. The same goes for the tazkiki and hummus. There was an abundance of fresh, vibrant herbs that enhanced each dish and tasted as if they had been harvested moments before hitting the plates. Meat eaters will appreciate the tender classics like gyros and kabobs, prepared with grass-fed beef. While vegetarians can't find falafels with sprouted chickpeas and organic parsley anywhere else in this region. Walking into The Grape Vine is like walking into another time and place where you are family, and you are well fed as if attending a feast or celebration. The portions are generous, and the prices are modest. You will leave abundantly satisfied, hoping that the location doesn't become spoiled by tourists or the bar crowds that occupy the Beach Blvd. scene. This gem of a restaurant shines bright among all of the commercial dining options as a true 'Mom and Pop' location. The bread is scratch-made, and nothing is ever prepared from frozen products. The experience of the cooks is undeniable, which is refreshing in an industry where there is so much want for passion. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

{"prompt":"Briefly summarize what this scientific news article says about the phenomenon of gravitational lensing caused by massive cosmic objects like galaxy clusters.\n\nHere's the source text:\nThe 1915 theory, which is occasionally called Einstein's geometric theory of gravity, predicts that, as bowling balls placed on a trampoline create a depression, objects with mass cause the very fabric of space-time to warp. This curvature gives rise to the force of gravity. And the greater the mass of a cosmic object, the more extreme the warping of space it causes.\n\nLight travels across the universe in straight lines, but when it encounters a warp caused by a truly massive object, its path is curved. When the warping object is between Earth and a background object, it can curve light in such a way that the apparent position of the background object is shifted.\n\nBut when the intermediate or \"lensing object\" is truly massive \u2014 like a monstrous cluster of galaxies, for example \u2014 light from the background source takes a different amount of time to reach Earth depending on how close it passes to the natural cosmic lens. \n\nThis effect, called gravitational lensing, can make single objects appear at multiple points in the sky, often in stunning arrangements called Einstein rings and Einstein crosses. It can also cause background objects to appear amplified in the sky, a powerful effect that astronomers use to observe distant and early faint galaxies.\n\nThe distortion caused by massive clusters like eMACS J1823.1+7822 can also help astronomers study mysterious dark matter, which accounts for around 85% of the mass in the universe but is invisible because it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation.

{"prompt":"Turn the facts in the source text into a series of questions with answers.\n\nTorts fall into three general categories: intentional torts (e.g., intentionally hitting a person); negligent torts (e.g., causing an accident by failing to obey traffic rules); and strict liability torts (e.g., liability for making and selling defective products - see Products Liability). Intentional torts are wrongs that the defendant knew or should have known would result through his or her actions or omissions. Negligent torts occur when the defendant's actions were unreasonably unsafe.

{"prompt":"Rewrite this story to be about a sea turtle who gets tangled in a net\n\nOnce upon a time there was a shy and quiet octopus.

Before he knew it, he had tied himself into one massive knot, and he couldn't move. He tried with all his strength to wriggle free, but it was no good. In the end, despite the great embarrassment he felt at being seen in such a tangle, he had to ask for help from the passing fish. Many fish swam past, ignoring him, but one very kind little fish offered to help to untie all those tentacles from all those suckers.\n\nThe octopus felt heartily relieved when he was finally set free, but he was so shy that he didn't dare talk to the fish and make friends with him. He simply thanked the fish, and quickly swam off. Later, the octopus spent the whole night thinking that he had wasted a great opportunity to make friends with that very kind little fish.\n\nA couple of days later the octopus was resting between some rocks, when he noticed that everyone around was hurriedly swimming past. He looked into the distance and saw an enormous fish coming over to feed in that area. The octopus quickly hid; then, peeping an eye out from his hiding place, he saw that the huge fish was chasing the kind little fish who had untied him. That little fish really needed urgent help, but the big fish was so dangerous-looking that no one dared to go near. The octopus, remembering how the little fish had helped him, felt that he had to do whatever he could to come to his aid.\n\nWithout hesitating, the octopus shot out from the rocks, like a ray. He put himself right in the path of the giant fish, and before the fish could do anything about it, the octopus had shot out the biggest jet of ink of his life.

Off he went to the rocks, looking for the octopus and the little fish.

Then the little fish told them all how he had helped the octopus a few days earlier, but he had never known anyone be so grateful that they would end up doing something so dangerous.

Fancy lived in a nice house in the countryside, where she and her companion Buddy the Schnauzer were both loved by their owners. Fancy loved to spend time with her owners, but when they went to work each day, she would go outside to spend time in the woods with Buddy. Even though dogs usually chase cats, Fancy and Buddy were both really good friends. However, they both enjoyed chasing a squirrel named Chip, who always evaded them by going up into the trees when they would show up.\n\nOne day, Buddy went out into the woods on his own, but he didn't come back for hours. This worried Fancy because Buddy never spent much time alone out in the woods. She decided that she needed to go find him before their owners came back home. So she set out into the woods to go find Buddy. She asked Chip if he knew where he was, but Chip was too scared to say anything because Fancy had always chased him and he was afraid she would do it again. \n\nFancy assured Chip that she would never chase him again and apologized for doing so before. This reassured Chip when he realized that Fancy was sincere, and he said that he had heard from one of the deer in the woods that Buddy had gone east. Fancy and Chip set off in the easterly direction. They asked other animals along the way if they had seen Buddy, but none of them had. Fancy was getting more worried. Finally, just when all hope seemed lost, they met a raccoon named Rex who said he had seen a Schnauzer go into a farmer's cornfield at the edge of the forest not too long ago. \n\nFancy and Chip went into the cornfield where they found Buddy! Buddy had gotten lost but he was so glad to see his friend Fancy again as they were reunited at last. He was surprised to see Chip, but Fancy told him that Chip was now their new friend too.

The Bokeh Gallery is mainly photographic artwork and digital collages. The Shade Gallery, however, is a significant space containing static and modular walls that can adapt to a variety of exhibitions. This is an ever-changing art space and is well-known by modern art enthusiasts. \n4. Perhaps you should try going to Perihelion Arts, which is a cutting-edge contemporary art gallery\/artist collective that was established by Amy Young. The gallery aims to reveal the very best of contemporary art to promote public interest in the arts, with a priority on art that pushes boundaries. This includes folk, surrealism, pop surrealism, outsider, and erotic art.\n5. Another option is Oblique Art, a contemporary urban arts space and pop-up gallery located in downtown Phoenix. Obliq Art was established in 2012 intending to showcase exceptional contemporary paintings, photography and mixed media created by local Arizona artists.\n\nThese options are some of the most popular options for modern art, but there is more where that came from.  Depending on how long you'll be staying in Scottsdale, you may want to visit even more exhibits. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

These irregular moons, including the fresh recruits, tend to cluster in groups, their formation dictated by the inclinations of their orbits. The gas titan's lunar system is home to three such confluences \u2014 the Inuit, Gallic, and Norse collectives, their names derived from diverse mythologies.\n\nEvery one of these freshly spotted moons has found a home within these three existing celestial families. While three of the new moons have pledged their allegiance to the Inuit family, the Norse clan has claimed the majority.\n\nThese celestial assemblies are postulated to have sprung into existence following catastrophic collisions between larger moons, initially ensnared by Saturn, resulting in cosmic fragmentation. Scrutinizing the orbits of these irregular moons could lend astronomers key insights into the annals of such celestial skirmishes within Saturn's domain.\n\nThe architects of this new discovery speculate that the profusion of miniature moons in a retrograde orbit \u2014 a trajectory contrary to the planet's own orbit \u2014 is a testament to a cataclysmic event as recent as 100 million years ago. This space disaster is thought to be the celestial birthplace of the Norse group of moons.\n\n\"The fringes of contemporary telescopic capabilities reveal that a moderately sized moon, trailing a path against Saturn's orbit, was blasted into oblivion approximately 100 million years ago,\" proclaimed Brett Gladman, an esteemed astronomer at the University of British Columbia, in an official statement.\n\nThe celestial competition for moon supremacy witnessed a temporary upset when Jupiter, the solar system's behemoth, edged ahead of Saturn in February 2023.

Please give me five options I could go with, and tell me a bit about them. ","role":"user"},{"content":"I can do that! Here are five classic supernatural creatures you might want to incorporate into your story.\n\n1: Vampires: Vampires have been used in mythology and stories for centuries, and there have been many iterations of them. Their lore tends to be that they are undead creatures of the night, with long fangs used to drink blood, and they can often turn into bats. Some versions of vampires created for stories or present in mythology are allergic to garlic, burned by sunlight, and can only be killed by a crucifix. \n2. Werewolves: Another classic supernatural creature often presented as a mortal enemy of the vampire is the werewolf. The werewolf is a creature that presents as human most of the time but, on a full moon, turns into a wolf. Depending on the story, this may be a classic version of a wolf or it may be a more monstrous version. Legends often say that if someone is bitten by a werewolf on the full moon, they will then turn into one.\n3. Ghosts: Ghosts are also supernatural creatures and subjects of many stories, and are typically humans who did not pass onto the afterlife, leaving a form of them stuck wandering the earth. Ghosts may be friendly to humans or not. There are many other names for ghosts, such as specters, spirits, and poltergeists (who are usually evil ghosts).\n4. Mages: Mages are humans who have been gifted with the ability of magic, also called witches, wizards, and sorcerers. Mages may be good, evil, or inherently neither in a story, and the magic they can do may vary. Sometimes, mages are not separate creatures at all but humans who have learned to do magic. They may also have animal familiars, though this is typically for witches.\n5. Demons: Born from religion, demons are also supernatural creatures that are sometimes used in fictional stories. They are creatures who have come from Hell, and may or may not have been human a long time ago, depending on the iteration of them. They are there to cause chaos and even harm to humans and usually make good villains in a story.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Florida Weave - This support system is made from strings tied horizontally to a few stakes that go along a row of tomatoes. The string creates the support.\n3. Cage - Cages constructed from wire are placed over the top of the tomato plant, providing support as the plant grows up through the cage center.\n4. Vertical String - This method requires an overhead structure that a string is tied to. The string is pulled tight and staked in the ground, creating support.\n5.

{"prompt":"Can you summarize the benefits of time tracking mentioned in the article?\n\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned So Far A few early observations: 1. Time tracking takes time! But mostly it takes mindfulness. Learning to monitor what you\u2019re doing every 15 minutes takes some getting used to. I often find myself looking up and suddenly realizing I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ve done for the last 40 minutes, sometimes longer\u2014which of course is notable in itself. On the positive side, I like seeing the columns fill up. I can tell there are patterns to be deciphered and improved upon. *There\u2019s an option to track your time every half-hour if fifteen-minute intervals feels excessive, but so far I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll stick with fifteen. 2. The mere act of tracking my time helps me be more intentional. When I know I have to account for my time, even if only to myself, I find myself making wiser decisions. I plan my days more carefully. I started writing this post a few days ago, but I\u2019m finishing it while waiting for a replacement driver\u2019s license at the DMV. It\u2019s not unusual for me to productively use waiting time. I think what\u2019s different is that today I made this my default state instead of just looking at my phone or zoning out. I knew I\u2019d need to account for what became a 30-minute wait, so I made sure to use it well. 3. Momentum matters. Week I of tracking my time flew by and I only got behind a couple of afternoons. With a trip to New York City and a few other things that threw off my schedule in Week II, I got much more behind. There\u2019s definitely a sense of momentum or inertia to this process: stay on track and you\u2019ll want to keep it going, lose a few hours and you\u2019ll feel discouraged. Laura notes that most people have irregular weeks, but you shouldn\u2019t wait for a \u201cregular\u201d week to start tracking. Disruptions happen in every week. I always have different projects to work on and I typically travel every week, so if I waited for a \u201cnormal\u201d week at home I\u2019d be waiting a long time. If I continue this discipline beyond another couple of weeks, I\u2019ll need to make sure I integrate it into my traveling life. 4. I don\u2019t feel guilty about intentional time that isn\u2019t spent productively. I don\u2019t really have hobbies (I\u2019ve tried!) and I sometimes say that relaxing stresses me out. There are a lot of intervals I filled up with items \u201creading,\u201d \u201cwalking to gym,\u201d \u201cphone call with a friend,\u201d or even \u201csearch for mistake fares for post-WDS Asia trip.\u201d And I liked that! I don\u2019t feel that these things detract from my other goals at all. I don\u2019t want to avoid or minimize them; in some ways I\u2019d like to do more of them. What I want to avoid is wasted time. Almost every day I have numerous 15-minute intervals that I don\u2019t know what to label because I don\u2019t remember what I did. This, at least for me, means that I frittered away the time without doing anything productive or taking time for myself in an intentional way.","prompt_id":"b08c932b530adc87bb42622eb35f8cc95e5307572552efbeeb8239e222b7d02b","messages":[{"content":"Can you summarize the benefits of time tracking mentioned in the article?\n\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned So Far A few early observations: 1.

If I continue this discipline beyond another couple of weeks, I\u2019ll need to make sure I integrate it into my traveling life. 4. I don\u2019t feel guilty about intentional time that isn\u2019t spent productively. I don\u2019t really have hobbies (I\u2019ve tried!) and I sometimes say that relaxing stresses me out. There are a lot of intervals I filled up with items \u201creading,\u201d \u201cwalking to gym,\u201d \u201cphone call with a friend,\u201d or even \u201csearch for mistake fares for post-WDS Asia trip.\u201d And I liked that! I don\u2019t feel that these things detract from my other goals at all. I don\u2019t want to avoid or minimize them; in some ways I\u2019d like to do more of them. What I want to avoid is wasted time. Almost every day I have numerous 15-minute intervals that I don\u2019t know what to label because I don\u2019t remember what I did. This, at least for me, means that I frittered away the time without doing anything productive or taking time for myself in an intentional way.","role":"user"},{"content":"Time tracking allows you to be more mindful, intentional, and productive. It helps maintain momentum and avoid wasted time while also allowing for intentional leisure time. By tracking how time is spent, individuals can identify time-wasting activities and adjust their schedules accordingly. This creates more time for productive tasks and ensures consistent progress toward goals. Additionally, intentional leisure time prevents burnout and promotes overall well-being.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Summarize"}

Yeah, I'm a north sider from Chicago and I bleed Cubby blue but Sosa is nothing short of a legend. He brought baseball back from the brink of obscurity and now baseball just wants to use him as a scapegoat.\n\nEvery baseball fan from the 90s remembers Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire chasing Roger Maris' record and finally eclipsing it. The year was 1998 and it captivated the whole nation. Two men from historic rival teams going all summer long trying to outlast and outhit the other. It was nothing short of epic and without Sosa's race, baseball would not be the popular sport that it is today.\n\nHis resume is impressive too. He hit over 600 home runs which not even 10 players in the entire history of the sport have done. He also won an MVP award in 1998 and numerous other awards like Silver Sluggers and was a perennial all-star. Sammy Sosa embodied baseball in the late 90s and early 00s. But now the industry is doing him wrong by trying to sweep him and all those other great hitters under the rug.\n\nYes, I know it was the steroid era.  But everyone was juicing and we all knew it. It was that unspoken compact that nobody ever brought up because it didn't need to be said. The league knew it and wanted to profit from all the eyes on the sport, we fans knew it but we were enjoying the competition too much to care, and the players knew it but were reaching new heights in their careers. I'm not saying it was okay but I am saying the players we loved shouldn't be the ones bearing the blame for it all. I, as a fan, share in the culpability and still want the best of that era in the hall. Players like Sosa.\n\nSo please don't let his legacy fade away. The numbers back it up and if you want to shave off 100 home runs he's still an amazing athlete. Plus you add on how much he helped revive America's past-time and it can't be denied that Sosa belongs in the hallowed halls of Cooperstown. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

He called for a Grand Jury to be empaneled, and Judge Valjean Biddison said that its investigation would begin June 8. The jury was selected by June 9. Judge Biddison expected that the state attorney general would call numerous witnesses, both black and white, given the large scale of the riot.[120]\n\nState Attorney General S.P. Freeling initiated the investigation, and witnesses were heard over 12 days. In the end, the all-white jury attributed the riot to the black mobs, while noting that law enforcement officials had failed in preventing the riot.

In the end, no one was convicted of charges for the deaths, injuries or property damage.[121]\n\nOn June 3, a group of over 1,000 businessmen and civic leaders met, resolving to form a committee to raise funds and aid in rebuilding Greenwood. Judge J. Martin, a former mayor of Tulsa, was chosen as the chairman of the group.

The rest of the United States must know that the real citizenship of Tulsa weeps at this unspeakable crime and will make good the damage, so far as it can be done, to the last penny.[120]\nMany black families spent the winter of 1921\u20131922 in tents as they worked to rebuild. Charles Page was commended for his philanthropic efforts in the wake of the riot in the assistance of 'destitute blacks'.[122]\n\nA group of influential white developers persuaded the city to pass a fire ordinance that would have prohibited many black people from rebuilding in Greenwood. Their intention was to redevelop Greenwood for more business and industrial use and force black people further to the edge of the city for residences. The case was litigated and appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by Buck Colbert Franklin, where the ordinance was ruled unconstitutional. Most of the promised funding was never raised for the black residents, and they struggled to rebuild after the violence. Willows, the regional director of the Red Cross, noted this in his report, explaining his slow initial progress to facilitate the rehabilitation of the refugees. The fire code was officially intended to prevent another tragedy by banning wooden frame construction houses in place of previously burnt homes. A concession was granted to allow temporary wooden frame dwellings while a new building, which would meet the more restrictive fire code, was being constructed. This was quickly halted as residents within two weeks had started to erect full-sized wooden frame dwellings in contravention of the agreement. It took a further two-month delay to secure the court decision to reinstate the previous fire code. Willows heavily criticized the Tulsa city officials for interfering with his efforts, for their role in the Public Welfare Committee which first sought to rezone the \"burned area\" as industrial, and for constructing a union station in its place with no consideration for the refugees. Then he criticized them again for the dissolution of the Public Welfare Committee in favor of the formation of the Reconstruction Committee which failed to formulate a single plan, leaving the displaced residents prohibited from beginning reconstruction efforts for several months.[123]","prompt_id":"337b717c1f272ab85cb27f6cb1ffc7fd07560f7812ac6be8acffb57d5d57c6c3","messages":[{"content":"Sum this up for me in one paragraph with 6 sentences.

Though law enforcement was also implicated in failing to prevent the riot, no one was ever charged for the violence or property damage. On June 3, businessmen and civic leaders met to discuss raising funds and aid for rebuilding Greenwood, claiming that Tulsa had just suffered something worthy of shame and humiliation and restitution was their only way to recover. Despite this resolve, many black families were forced to live in tents during the winter of 1921-1922 as they worked to rebuild the district. On top of that, a group of influential white developers passed a fire ordinance that would prohibit full-sized wooden frame buildings to be constructed in the area, making it nearly impossible for most of the black families to rebuild. These developers wanted to redevelop the area for business and industry so that black people would be forced to move further from the center of the city.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Summarize"}

The band's singer and lyricist, Robert Plant, has said that he drew inspiration from the work of Scottish writer Lewis Spence, notably from his book Magic Arts in Celtic Britain. This influence is a strong part of the mysticism and allegories contained within the lyrics. There are references to the May Queen, an allusion to the Virgin Mary, as well as the Piper and the Wild West. The song explores themes of purity, materialism, greed, arrogance, and spirituality. The ultimate message that Led Zeppelin put forward in this song is that the Stairway to Heaven is a spiritual journey made up of discovering the power of community and our need to live together in harmony with our souls and nature. It is a message of solidarity, brotherhood, and equality.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Open QA"}

Turtles don't need a lot of attention, or expensive training classes like many other pets. What turtles do need is a proper diet. In this article, I'll tell you what you need to know about feeding your pet turtle. \n\nTurtles are omnivores, which means they eat plant and animal matter. You can feed your pet turtle pellets, cooked meats (like chicken or turkey), leafy greens (like collards), fruits (like apples and bananas) or even live insects (like crickets). However, some foods are bad for your turtle, like chives and spinach. It's best to do your research when you're deciding whether or not to add a certain food to your turtle's diet. \n\nTurtles need to be fed more often when they're young. Juvenile turtles need to eat around twice a day. Adult turtles are usually fine with eating just once every day, or even once every other day depending on the species. When you feed your turtle, leave the food there for about 20 minutes, then take it away. That's generally enough time for turtles to eat what they need. Remember that different species of turtles can have different feeding needs, so research you're turtle before deciding on a specific feeding plan. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

It makes you think that some of them might be fake! I am pleased to report, though, that this product is well-deserving of its high marks.\n\nI\u2019ve been having some issues with ex-boyfriends going on social media and trashing me. It is so obnoxious. They say things like \"She\u2019s a weirdo,\" \"Stay away from her,\" and \"She talks about revenge all of the time!\" And clearly, that\u2019s not true! I talk about soap operas sometimes, too.\n\nMy first purchase of a shrink-ray gun from Amazon was a disappointment. If you look at the reviews for the Widget Company Shrink-Ray Gun (my alias is @uwillpay), you\u2019ll see that this was a far inferior product. The degree of shrinkage on that gun was a low 75%. I\u2019m sorry, but an ex-boyfriend who's 2 feet tall is still way too big\u2014are you with me? I donated it to charity. It was like a kid's toy or something.\n\nBut the Acme Shrink-Ray Gun far outperformed the competition. When I waited in the shadows at Jerry\u2019s house until he came outside with the trash, the Acme Shrink-Ray Gun got the job done! Jerry shrank from 6 feet to one inch. I\u2019m serious, this is a great product! Well, of course, I did zap him again, and he\u2019s probably riding on the back of a flea right now or something.

Yielding to the pleas of the Luminary Sisters, the emperor and empress allowed them to transport Nova to a secure sanctuary on a remote celestial body.\nOn her sixteenth solar return, Stella, the former Princess Nova, had grown into an astoundingly beautiful young woman. Her mind teemed with knowledge and her heart was filled with compassion. The Luminary Sisters had prepared a clandestine celebration in her honor, but they also had a mission for her. They tasked her with gathering cosmic energy from distant nebulae.\n\nStella set out on her journey, and as she traveled, she befriended the sentient beings of the universe. She serenaded them with her celestial melody, \"Cosmic Lullaby.\" Her song was so beautiful that it filled them with peace and joy. At the same time, Prince Orion, now a dashing space explorer, was detecting the ethereal resonance of Stella's song. He was instantly captivated by her allure. He knew that he had to meet her. Despite interstellar protocols against interactions with strangers, Stella and Orion found themselves irresistibly drawn to one another. They met up at the sanctuary that night, and they fell in love. Their love was forbidden, but they didn't care. They knew that they were meant to be together. They would face any challenge to be with each other. Stella and Orion's love was a force of nature. It was the power of true love, and it could not be denied.\nMeanwhile, Astra and Celestia engage in a dispute over the luminescent hue of Stella's gown, inadvertently attracting the attention of Malvora's cunning servant, Nebula, who discovers Stella's location. Upon returning home, Stella eagerly divulges her newfound love to her guardians. Finally, the Luminary Sisters reveal to Stella her true lineage as a princess, destined for an arranged union, warning her never to cross paths with the man she has come to love. With a heavy heart, Stella retreats to her quarters, tears streaming down her face. Orion confides in King Regulus about the extraordinary woman he encountered and his desire to unite with her, defying the constraints of his predestined marriage. Despite King Regulus' futile attempts to persuade his son otherwise, Orion remains devastated.\n\nStella is escorted by the Luminary Sisters to the imperial palace in preparation for her sixteenth-cycle celebration, where she will at last meet her birth parents. Stella is lured into a restricted area of the palace by Malvora when she sees her as a weak spot. There, Stella pricks her finger on a dormant energy source that resembles a spindle, breaking the curse. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

One day, as she was walking through the park, she stumbled upon a beautiful unicorn with a rainbow mane and a shimmering horn.

Here are some ways people choose names for new things:\n- The Creator's Name - Many people include their own last or first name in a flower they create or discover. This ensures that they are remembered as being the person who created it. This can be their unaltered name, a nickname, or an alteration of their name that seems to fit the plant more for whatever reason. \n- Someone's Name - Along with being named after the creator, it is also fairly common to name a plant after a loved one, a movie star, a mentor, etc. \n- It's Appearance - Most flowers are named after something that has to do with their appearance, whether this is the shape of their leaves, the color of their flowers, or something else unique about the plant. For example, a flower variation that is blue might be named Sky Blue, Ocean View, or something else that brings to mind the color. \n- Something Important - Some people who name things choose a name that has meaning for them. For example, if you have another hobby besides your flowers that you enjoy, you could include that hobby in the name. Also, if you have been through a tough time, you can make the name hopeful or include any word that has meaning to you.\nHopefully, this helps you come up with name ideas for your new flower!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

This can be very hard for some but there are quite a few things you can do to gradually improve. Living in the moment is an expression commonly used, but people often brush off the real meaning. Living in the moment is to enjoy the things you are doing, to actively know what you are doing, and to take it all in. You may find yourself spacing out sometimes, but try your best to focus on the things around you. The best exercise to practice mindfulness is meditation. Meditation is not only sitting down with your legs crossed as often thought, but meditation is the practice of focus. Calming yourself, and controlling your thoughts and breathing, allows you to become more aware. You can also do this while walking. This will help you to become more focused on the things you are doing. \n\nOverall, being mindful does not just happen. You have to actively do things in order to feel the effects.

It's a little round car that embarrasses him until he learns it's a robot space alien named Lady Bugg. The presence of the Patriotic-insert-bots causes the Bad-bots to attack Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela Bads. More Patriotic-insert-bots arrive on Earth to find the McGuffinBox which is a source of limitless power that can create life and entire worlds which is ironic considering the lifeless sales pitch of this movie that will use 4th wall breaks to self-parody itself in an attempt to dodge any criticism.\n\nIt turns out the McGuffinBox can only be created by fusing 19,000 sponsors. Advertisements flood the screen culminating in a battle between products and companies with some CGI video game assets thrown into the mix to make fans think there's something, anything at all, resembling the original show. Dimwitwitkee and Bads are captured by government spies after a full-scale ad and Bad-bot assault on a military base, the walls of which are covered in logos to create camouflage. They agree to help the government and then aren't tracked at all because that's absolutely what would happen and is totally believable. But it turns out they lied because the US wants to destroy the good Patriotic-insert-bots too, in a nonsensical moral shoehorned to make audiences forget that the real purpose of the film is to sell sponsorship segments. Sam and Mikaela go on a treasure hunt and find another random plot device that's amorphous and never shown yet somehow reveals to them the secret location of the McGuffinBox.\n\nWith the Bad-bots supposedly defeated, the screen fades to black before returning to show a strange metal world where more evil robots are being created followed by a QR code with a survey link containing 20 ads per page.

Here are some ideas for what the guns could shoot: \n\n- Lasers - There already exists lasers that can cut through things, so the guns could have this in them. Pulling the trigger turns it on, and you could say that to prevent it from overheating, it can only turn on for half a second at a time. \n- Explosives - Think of this option like a miniature grenade launcher. In your sci-fi world, they have invented highly volatile compounds that will explode with only a few drops. These few drops are put in something the size and shape of a bullet. How powerful you want the explosive to be is up to you. \n- Poison Vials - Guns could fire small containers of an easily obtained poison or chemical. Perhaps there are even different grades of poison, depending on how lethal you want it to be. The vials always break when they are shot at something, and if the poison is acidic enough, can melt into whatever they are shot at. Maybe only a few drops need to touch the skin for the person to die. \n- Nanites - A group of nanites could be in a ball or any other shape and are programmed to only attach when fired and to attack whatever they are fired at. \n\nI hope these ideas are helpful!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

The story has apparently grown beyond the scope of the mountaineering community as many have been interviewed by the media. Allegations and critiques have come from many sources. Have climbers in the 2006 season left a man to die when he still had a chance to be saved? Sources say that Sharp tried to climb the mountain by himself with no guides, and it's said he even brought fewer oxygen bottles than normal. His guide firm in Nepal was a low-budget service that provided him service as far as Base Camp, but after that point, they expect climbers to continue as a \"loose group,\" which allows for a great deal of independence. The manager told us that Sharp didn't have enough oxygen with him for his climb and chose not to have a Sherpa guide. The question is who knew that Sharp was in trouble? If they did know, were they even qualified or capable of helping him? \n\nOne fellow climber, a double-amputee named Mark Inglis, claims that his party, along with several others, passed Sharp on their trek. He was reportedly sheltering beneath a rock overhang that was 450 metres below the summit, but none attempted a rescue. Inglis also said that 40 people had passed Sharp, but they might not have noticed him and instead thought he was the corpse nicknamed \"Green Boots.\" What Inglis didn't know was that a party of Turkish climbers did try to help Sharp, even though they were already helping an injured woman (Turkish Bur\u00e7ak Po\u00e7an). Himex has also been discussed in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. It's interesting to note that Inglis later revises his story, claiming that at the time he was first interviewed, he was \"...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite--he later had five fingertips amputated.\" A search of Sharp's possessions found a receipt for US$7,490 which is thought to be his entire cost for the climb. Most expeditions cost between $35,000 and $100,000, not to mention an additional $20,000 in other expenses like gear and bonuses. It is believed that Sharp summited on 14 May before beginning his descent, but on 15 May he encountered trouble. At this point, he was being passed by other climbers, and it's believed that he was experiencing hypoxia at around 300 metres from the summit.\n\nBeck Weathers, who participated in the 1996 Mount Everest expedition that ended in disaster, claims that those who are dying tend to be left behind. Apparently, he had been left for dead himself on two separate occasions but had been able to keep walking and save himself. The Tribune of Chandigarh, India describes Sharp's predicament as \"the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering.\" Nine other climbers also died in 2006, including Sherpas working for guide firms. \n\nThe Discovery Channel captures a lot of the controversy in their television program Everest: Beyond the Limit. One very important piece of  Sharp's story is shown in the program when an early-returning climber named Maxim Chaya radioed his base camp manager (Russell Brice) to say that he had found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya couldn't identify Sharp because he had chosen to not identify himself to other climbers. Instead of sending help, the base camp manager assumed that Sharp was a member of a group that had already abandoned him. He told Chaya that he wouldn't be able to help Sharp on his own, so Chaya left him. Sharp's condition continued to worsen and his chances of rescue grew smaller as climbers continue to pass him in their descent. The frostbite was making his legs and feet curl, preventing him from walking, and later descending climbers were low on oxygen and strength themselves. As the day continued, time ran out for Sherpas to come back and rescue him. \n\nSharp's body remained where it was, just below the summit on the Chinese side, next to \"Green Boots.\" They shared a small rock cave that also acted as their tomb. The BBC reports that Sharp's body was removed in 2007, and Green Boots has been missing since 2014, likely moved or buried. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

Although people didn\u2019t believe he was right for the job, after the first film came out, the masses were mad at Keaton as \n   Batman. \n- Kevin Conroy: Technically the most accurate Batman to date, Kevin Conroy gave Batman the voice every actor has used since. \n- Val Kilmer: Though some say that Val Kilmer was a good Batman, many felt as though he was no Michael Keaton and were unimpressed with the sudden change. \n- George Clooney: In 1997, George Clooney was nowhere near as famous as he is now, and while his role as Batman certainly didn\u2019t hurt his career, it also didn\u2019t do anything to further it as everyone who watched it \n   seemed to hate it. \n- Christian Bale: By the time Christian Bale came into the role, audiences didn\u2019t expect much from Batman actors.

However, the general consensus now is that Affleck excelled in the \n   role due to his rugged good looks and charm. \n- Robert Pattinson: Playing the role very differently than anyone before, Pattinson made Batman the strange orphan he actually was, and once again, although no one thought he would excel in the role, he surprised \n   bat-fans everywhere with his take on the character.

We all know how tempting it can be to write off ex-lovers, nightmare bosses, former friends, and difficult family members by giving them an armchair diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder\u2014but the reality of NPD is a bit more complex and nuanced than many people realize.\n\n2. When you\u2019ve got a difficult narcissist in your life, it can be all too easy to presume that their problematic behavior stems from an overabundance of self-love, when in fact the opposite is true; despite their bravado, people suffering from narcissistic personality disorder are actually deeply insecure.\n\n3. It\u2019s ironic that the myth of Narcissus\u2014the tale that forms most people\u2019s understanding of Narcissistic Personality Disorder\u2014portrays the young man staring ceaselessly at his mirror image because, in real life, NPD could be explained as an inability to reflect or look inward.\n\n4. If you have a difficult narcissistic personality in your life\u2014or several\u2014you may be put off by the suggestion that you see a professional therapist for your struggles since you\u2019re not the one with a problem; but seeing as people with NPD are extremely unlikely to seek professional help or change themselves, this may actually be your best option.\n\n5. If you\u2019ve been going in circles with the narcissist in your life and feeling ready to pull your hair out, you may be surprised to learn that narcissism isn\u2019t always a bad thing; in fact, some of us would actually be better off if we had a stronger narcissistic impulse.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

He only came as part of a mandatory business trip, and now he had to see his coworker\u2019s plates piled higher than their chests with gooey cheese bites and crispy shrimp. The slot machines on The Strip failed to tempt Stu when his coworkers were gambling their money away in celebration of closing the new deal, but the honey-glaze on the bbq ribs had a different type of power.\n\nAs a courtesy, Stu had paid for a plate before sitting down because the anxiety to come if the buffet staff might suspect him of sneaking food without paying would be unbearable. So, there it was: a large, empty white plate sitting in front of him. The buffet ticket included a drink, but Stu refused that pleasure as well. Stu began rethinking his life decisions. He had been on this new diet for months and other diets for years with no rewards to show for any of it. The only thing he gained was a conversation topic everyone was tired of hearing about. Stu could no longer simply place the entire blame on food\u2014there must be a different solution.\n\nStu had enough. The conversating coworkers around him fell silent as they noticed him pick up his plate and excuse himself from the table. No one could believe it. They watched him at the first buffet bar. Then, to the second. Stu stopped at every single station along the route and picked up at least one food item from the inviting warming platters. Stu\u2019s eyes must have been piercing through the plexiglass sanitary guards as he drafted each piece of his bounty.\n\nReturning to the table, Stu\u2019s plate was so tall it obscured his eye line. His tablemates peered from either side of the food tower and saw Stu smiling for the first time in months\u2014years, maybe. Stu proceeded to have the time of his life at the buffet and allowed that experience to renew him to forgo dieting altogether, beginning his search for a new path to a healthier lifestyle.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

If they don\u2019t, the land loses its tax subsidy and can be sold for commercial development.\n\nIn other words, about 80 percent of the farms protected under the law were eligible to come up for sale in 2022. \u201cThese areas are nearly 45 percent of the agricultural land in Tokyo,\u201d says Ryoto Matsuzawa.","role":"user"},{"content":"Between 2005 and 2015, the number of farms in Tokyo decreased by 14.5 percent and the average age of farmers increased by 3.3 years. Preserving Tokyo's remaining 1,250 small farms feels priceless to many, but there is an ongoing issue where many cities cannot afford to buy the land protected under the Productive Green Areas Law at market value, as legally required. This leads to the land being lost for agricultural use, and usually being sold for commercial development.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Summarize"}

Blue - This is the most highly recommended color to wear according to experts. The color blue can convey a feeling of trustworthiness and credibility, which are good traits no matter what position you're going for.\n\n2. Black - This color is usually associated with leadership, strength, and ability. Of course, these are great qualities to convey, but keep in mind that it may appear to be too aloof if you're applying for a position in customer service for example.\n\n3. Grey - This color, although neutral, can convey a logical and analytical professional. Keep in mind that if you tend to sweat when you're nervous, grey will show this more, so you may want to keep the color only on pants or a jacket.\n\n4. White - White gives the impression of someone who is organized, detail-oriented, and clean. This is a classic color that can be matched with just about anything else, so consider adding some colorful accessories that show more of who you are.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Someone said I should have a few tools around for gigs.

This can be handy for tightening loose screws on equipment or making sure the knobs on your gear are secure. There are hobbyist screwdrivers that have multiple tips stored in the body or shaft. In a pinch, you could even use the mini toolset for repairing eyeglasses. These sets are often cheap and low quality, but the screwdrivers tend to be good enough for a quick fix on stage.\n\n- A flashlight. While there may be stage lighting during the performance, if you need to make a quick repair, it is better to have a small but effective light source of your own, in case of emergencies. You can certainly use the big bulky one from home, but a pen light might be more effective and easier to use when you need to hold tools as well. If hands-free is your thing, you could also get a headlamp, which usually has a small strap attached to it. But if you have a modern cell phone, you probably already have an app that turns on the camera flash.\n\n- Pliers. A small pair of pliers can work wonders for a bent jack or for cutting and replacing a broken string. They don\u2019t need to be too big, and you can usually find a small set of two or three at your favorite hardware store. \n\n- Allen\/hex key set. These might not be completely necessary for certain players, but Allen screws are used on a lot of musical equipment, so it would be a good idea to have a set around. While you can buy keys as a set for a toolbox, keep on the lookout for a set that looks like a Swiss Army knife, commonly called a Gui-Tool. These specialty tools often have screwdriver bits built in, making it a very effective multi-tool to have in your arsenal.\n\nAlthough there are far more tools available, this should get you started and have you prepared for many unforeseen circumstances at your show.

Cat Carrier: It's important to keep your cat safe during travel, so make sure to pick out an appropriate-sized carrier for bringing your kitten home and on future vet trips.\n2. Kitten Food: Kittens need nutrient-packed food to support their growth, unlike adult cats, so make sure to pick out an appropriate food.\n3. Bowls: Food bowls come in many different forms. You could choose an elevated bowl, slow feeder, or automatic feeder, and even treat your cat to a water fountain (which will encourage them to hydrate).\n4. Treats: Treats are one of the best ways to help your kitten bond with you!\n5. Nail Trimmer: Routine nail trims protect your cat from infections and ingrown nails, as well as protect your furniture.\n6: Cat Brush: It's important to keep your cat well-groomed to avoid mats, particularly if your cat has medium or long hair. Long-haired cats should be brushed every day, while shorter hair cats should be brushed around once a week. \n7. Toothbrush and Kitty Toothpaste: To keep your cat's teeth healthy and prevent gum disease, you'll want to introduce your kitten to teeth brushing as early as possible. This helps desensitize them in the future and makes the task easier.\n8. Toys: There are a wide variety of kitten toys on the market, so choose some that look fun and experiment with what your cat likes. Every kitten is different!\n9. Scratching Post: All cats scratch. If you don't give them an outlet, it might be on your couch! Consider spacing multiple scratching posts around the house.\n10. Cat Bed: Your cat may never use their bed, but it's nice to have it if they'd like their own space.\n11. Cat Tree: Cats feel safest in high spots, which means a cat tree can help them feel at home in their new place quickly. Choose one with lots of hiding spots and high-up places for your kitten to call their own.\n12. ID Tag and Collar: While you hope your kitten never sneaks out, if they do, it's critical anyone who finds them can identify them. Make sure their ID tag has your contact information.\n\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Plank\nThe plank is the most renowned exercise that targets your entire core. A plank is an exceptional way to strengthen your abs and your obliques and work your deep muscle to increase your overall stability and power. To perform a plank, start in a pushup position, then move down to rest your weight on your forearms with your hands touching so that your arms can form a V shape. From this position, maintain your straight posture and avoid your stomach sagging. Hold the position for as long as you can. It won't be long before you feel the burn. \n\n2. Side plank\nPay particular attention to your obliques by performing a side plank as an alternative to a normal plank. Start by getting into a standard plank position. Next, rotate your body so that one side of your body faces the sky. Squeeze your core with one leg straight out and your body stiff in a straight line. Squeeze your core and hold the pose for as long as possible before switching sides. Make sure to try equal lengths on both sides so that you don't get muscle imbalances. \n\n3. Reverse Crunches\nCrunches are a great exercise for your core, but this variation adds a slight degree of difficulty if you are finding standard crunches too easy. This exercise works the lower abs, in particular. Start in a standard crunch position, lying down with your knees bent. Keep your hands flat on the ground next to your hips. To perform the exercise, lift your pelvis and knees towards your face. Return to the starting position and repeat as many times as you can. \n\n4. Flutter kicks\nSometimes the lower abs can get less attention, but flutter kicks can help to address that. This exercise makes sure you strengthen a common area of weakness. Lay flat on the ground with your arms flat and legs stretched out. From here, lift your feet about 6 inches off the ground and hold them there. Once you have done this, start lifting right and left. Lift each leg about a few inches each time. Ensure to maintain good posture and bring each leg to rest before moving to the next. \n\n5. Arms high sit-ups\nEveryone knows sit-ups, and those who work their abs a lot may be easy by now. This exercise gives your abs a killer workout that they won't forget. It is as easy as starting in a sit-up position. From here, raise your hands straight up to the sky, flatten your hands, and reach for the sky. Now perform a sit-up as you normally would. This is going to be a lot harder than a standard sit-up so make sure your form is correct to achieve maximum results. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Unusually silent -- everyone must be asleep already.\n\nMost nights, I\u2019d amuse myself by counting the lights as they went out, or listening to a village mother yelling for her children to come home to bed. I\u2019d pass the time guessing their names, or what they looked like. Tonight though, the villagers must be in bed early. \n\nI huff, disappointed.

I get back up and swing again. Wheeee!\n\nSeveral hours pass, and I grow tired of that. What else can I do? Suddenly, I remember the sweet sounds of lutes from the village church. I unbraid my hair, and tie the loose ends tightly between two hooks, carefully spacing them.\n\nOnce they\u2019re up, I pluck one gently. Ping! I tighten and loosen them until they\u2019re perfect.\nEach hair makes a different sound, and I hum along.

{"prompt":"Put each sentence that has the word 'bat' or 'bats' into a bulleted list from the following paragraph. Remove any bracketed numbers. \n\nThe 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52-million-year-old Green River Formation, Onychonycteris finneyi, indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities.[20][21] Onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. It also had longer hind legs and shorter forearms, similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches, such as sloths and gibbons. This palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. Instead of flapping its wings continuously while flying, Onychonycteris probably alternated between flaps and glides in the air.[7] This suggests that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats, but flew from tree to tree and spent most of its time climbing or hanging on branches.[22] The distinctive features of the Onychonycteris fossil also support the hypothesis that mammalian flight most likely evolved in arboreal locomotors, rather than terrestrial runners.

It was the first really warm day of the season. The tops of the blades were getting too hot for my taste, so I slunk further down toward the soil. Here, it was shaded and cool. I had just nodded a polite \"hello\" to a few ants when an overwhelmingly loud noise started.\n\nAs a cricket, I know a thing or two about noise and vibration. My legs can create many different notes, and my communication increases or decreases in speed with the temperature, but this noise was constant and monotone. It was louder and closer than any other noise I'd ever heard in my short life, and it was growing even more so.\n\nSuddenly, the sun disappeared, and the noise was directly overhead. It caused a tremendous rumble. I slunk down even further into the safety of the tall grass, but the grass appeared to be cut in half! My antennae felt a strong gust, but as quickly as the monster had approached, it retreated. The grass was now barely long enough to cover my body. With the noise still in the distance, I hopped a couple of feet to the side and found longer grass in which to hide.\n\nOnly a few minutes later, the sound approached again. Once again, I hunkered down to the soil, and the grass above my body was sheered off and shortened. The monster retreated and I moved, again, towards the safety of the longer grass. The afternoon continued in this way for nearly an hour, pushing me into a corner of the yard near the wooden shed. There, I found safety inside a ceramic pot and prayed that the monster only had a taste for grass and not pottery. \n\nSoon after, the noise stopped. I assumed the monster had gotten its fill of vegetation. There was a rumble, a rattle, and a clink-- but it seemed the monster had fallen asleep after its extremely large meal. Too scared and exhausted to leave my protective shell, I took a nap to recover enough energy to create a nighttime sonata.\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Why isn\u2019t one style best?","role":"user"},{"content":"The first thing you have to understand is that a positive dihedral (a wing that angles upward from the fuselage) creates roll stability \u2013 in other words, it will make the plane less inclined to roll to the left or right. The physics behind this so-called \"dihedral effect\" is complicated, but the basics are fairly easy to visualize; a positive dihedral moves the overall center of lift a little higher, placing it closer to \u2013 or sometimes above \u2013 the aircraft\u2019s total center of mass. Effectively, with enough dihedral effect, the weight is hanging under the force that\u2019s holding it up (as opposed to balancing on top).\u00a0\n\nAs you might expect, this sort of stability is often beneficial. You don\u2019t typically want your airliner or cargo plane to flip upside-down, after all. But there are reasons to angle the wing the other way.\u00a0\n\nOftentimes, when the wing is mounted high, the center of mass is already far below the center of the lift. This can make some roll maneuvers excessively difficult. A negative dihedral angle (often called an anhedral) can reduce this roll resistance to more reasonable levels. Many military cargo aircraft, like the An-124 and C-5, are designed this way.\n\nSome planes are built with a dihedral angle that intentionally reduces their roll stability. Though it sounds counterintuitive, fighter aircraft are most maneuverable if they are at least slightly aerodynamically unstable. The proper dihedral angle can help them hit the right balance between stability and instability.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

","role":"user"},{"content":"Here are five tips on how to respond to your boss's angry email along with an explanation for each suggestion:\n\n- Keep your response brief. Long replies run the risk of being misinterpreted. Pick one major point of contention within his email and respond directly to that. \n- Organize your thoughts. Don't reply with the first thing that springs to mind. Take a moment to try and understand the root of the issue, including analyzing the situation from your boss's perspective, and ensure your thoughts make sense before you send your reply.  \n- Be polite. De-escalate the situation by sending a calm and well-mannered reply. Resist the temptation to meet anger with anger as that could make a tense situation even worse. If you remain polite, you increase the likelihood that he will eventually calm down and your conversation can become productive.\n- Don't be defensive. Your boss is responding with emotion, not reason, so don't give him more justification to be emotional by sending a response that is overly defensive. Instead, appeal to his logic and reason so that you can work together to resolve the issue rather than argue about it. \n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

The low intelligence of the stupid raccoon makes the animal easy prey for other animals that are normally considered docile and unprovoking, such as rabbits and turtles.\n\nThe stupid raccoon is a docile, furry little creature that has the same physical appearance and characteristics as that of regular raccoons, but with one notable exception: they are absolutely stupid. Where other animals have the situational awareness and survival skills to scavage for food and shelter, stupid raccoons are unable to feed themselves unless humans put scraps of leftover dinner into plastic garbage bags and put them into garbage receptacles for easy access and consumption. However, while some of these raccoons have easy access to these tasty morsels of leftover food, many of them can become trapped in larger trash bins, becoming stuck and unable to escape back to their natural habitats. These stupid raccoons eventually require human intervention - in the form of a passerby noticing the raccoons inside and lending a helping hand - or they will eventually be transported along with the trash within these receptacles and taken to a nearby landfill where they will die from suffocation underneath thousands of tons of human refuse.\n\nStupid raccoons are living beings that deserve our help, just like any other creature on our beautiful planet. Without intervention, approximately 32,000 are expected to die each year, resulting in a dwindling population that can impact the ecosystem and a lot fewer of these stupid (but cute) animals on the planet. While they are unbelievably dumb creatures, stupid raccoons are also important to our ecosystem. The raccoons provide such vital functions as entertainment for humans, emotional support for ants, and natural garbage disposals for trash.\n\nWith your donation of just five dollars a minute, we can help round up the stupid raccoon population and put them into safe living areas that will provide them with the opportunity to survive and thrive without falling victim to the harsh environment of the urban world. Please help the stupid raccoon by donating today. Thank you.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

","role":"user"},{"content":"I can definitely do that. Here's your list going through tips for setting boundaries with your parents.\n\n1. Set boundaries with gratitude and appreciation - It isn't disrespectful to set boundaries, but you should still set them, and your parents should respect them. You can set boundaries and avoid possible hurt feelings by wording what you say carefully and sharing that you appreciate them,\n2. Be direct - It can be hard to get your parents to recognize that you're independent. This especially goes if you have moved back in with them. You can try to evade possible conflict by not saying anything, But, it's better to share your concerns rather than conceal them.\n3. Be clear - Being vague also doesn't help. When you set boundaries, you should be clear with your parents. This makes sure that they understand exactly what you mean. If they aren't getting it you can give them examples of things they've done that have upset you and tell them other things they can do instead.\n4. Compromise - Stating your boundaries can gently remind your parents that you make your own choices. If your boundaries aren't working for them, you should find some sort of compromise. If your parents ask inappropriate questions about your relationships, you can let them know it's okay to chat about your relationships but not go into a territory that's uncomfortable for you. When you find a middle ground, it can make everyone more satisfied with the outcome.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

It provided Lincoln with a pretense to invade Mexico.\nc. It greatly improved the supply situation for embattled Union forces.\nd. It caused significant damage to the Confederacy's economy and infrastructure, hastening the end of the war.\n\n2. Why did Lincoln have a falling out with General McClellan?\na. General McClellan was a Democrat, and Lincoln was a Republican.\nb. Lincoln was prejudiced against Catholic Americans.\nc. General McClellan regularly ignored Lincoln's orders and was seen as insubordinate to Lincoln. Notably, he did not attack the Confederates aggressively enough in Lincoln's view, failing to pursue Lee's army after the Battle of Antietam.\nd. General Grant and General McClellan despised each other, and Grant poisoned Lincoln's views of the latter.\n\n3. Why did the South make diplomatic overtures with the British Empire?\na. Britain was a major importer of Confederate cotton. As a major industrial power, Britain could tip the balance against the numerically and economically superior North.\nb. Britain supported the slave trade and was ideologically aligned with the South.\nc. Jefferson Davis had an illegitimate child with Queen Victoria.\nd. The Confederacy was a major importer of British pewter, and this economic relationship was viewed as critical to the British economy. Thus it was believed by Jefferson Davis that the British would be natural allies.\n\n4. Some historians have said that the Civil War was a preview of wars to come. In what way is this true?\na. It was the last war to feature muzzle-loading firearms.\nb. Near the end of the Civil War, advancements in weapons technology would result in trench warfare conditions, not unlike what would be seen in World War I. Artillery would become increasingly decisive whereas cavalry would be relegated to reconnaissance and messaging roles.\nc. Unlike previous wars fought for land or religion, the US Civil War was uniquely about ideology.\nd. It was the first offensive war the United States engaged in.\n\nAnswer Key:\n1. Answer: d.\n2.

The letter \"J\" evolved from the letter \"I\" in the late Middle Ages. Initially, \"I\" was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant. Over time, the consonantal form of \"I\" started to be written as \"J\" to avoid confusion. It wasn't until the 16th century that the distinction between the two letters became widely adopted.\n\nOn the other hand, \"U\" was added to differentiate it from \"V\". In Latin, \"V\" was used to denote both the \"u\" and \"v\" sounds, but with the evolution of languages and the introduction of lowercase letters, a need arose to distinguish these sounds. By the late Middle Ages, a rounded form of \"v\", which we know as \"u\", began to be used to represent the vowel sound, while \"v\" was used for the initial consonant sound. However, it wasn't until the mid-17th century that the usage of \"u\" and \"v\" as distinct letters became standardized in English.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Open QA"}

It is difficult to understand how much of this lifestyle change is happening around the world because we don't know if people are changing their behavior or even how they are changing behavior.  In this study, we are trying to find and describe these lifestyle and behavior changes.  We will compare our findings with the discoveries of other scientific studies.  In some instances, what we have discovered agrees with other scientific studies, but in other cases, it does not.  There have been a lot of studies that focus on how climate change might cause harm to people and their environment, but these studies don't discuss any lifestyle changes.  In addition, climate change is rarely the only reason people change their lifestyles.  Extreme climate change events will help create lifestyle changes in an area.  In more wealthy countries, most lifestyle changes are planned in advance to protect people from the effects of climate change.  Most lifestyle changes in response to climate change are happening in wealthy nations, with lifestyle change reports from middle-income and low-income countries being less common.

Here are some of the most popular hiking trails near Saratoga, Wyoming.\n1. Medicine Bow Peak Trail - This 3.4-mile out-and-back trail is the shortest of the three routes to Medicine Bow Peak. It's a moderately challenging route that takes an average of 2 hours and 20 minutes to complete. The best times to visit this area are May through October. Dogs are allowed, and they may be off-leash in certain areas. The trail begins at Lewis Lake, then climbs to the saddle between Sugarloaf Mountain and Medicine Bow Peak. From the saddle, the trail consists of steep switchbacks toward the peak, ending in a 0.1-mile scramble through a boulder field to the 12,013-foot summit. Medicine Bow Peak is the highest point in the Snowy Range and offers incredible 360-degree views of the surrounding region. \n2. Treasure Island Bridge Trail - This easy 1.8-mile out-and-back trail along the North Platte River takes an average of 30 minutes to complete. The trail crosses a suspension bridge onto Treasure Island, a long islet in the river. Dogs are welcome but must be leashed at all times. \n3. Silver Lake and Meadow Falls Loop Trail - This 3.8-mile loop trail takes you around Silver Lake to a secluded waterfall in the Medicine Bow National Forest. It's a moderately challenging hike that takes an average of 1 hour and 40 minutes to complete. You'll enjoy a wide variety of alpine forests and wildflower meadow scenery. The area is lightly trafficked, so it's unlikely that you'll encounter many other people here. The trailhead is located near the Silver Lake Campground.\n4. Lewis Lake, South Gap Lake, and Snowy Mountains Trail - This 2.9-mile out-and-back trail takes an average of 1 hour and 10 minutes to complete. The trailhead is located at Lewis Lake, near Sugarloaf Campground in the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest. It's a moderately challenging route that takes you past Lewis Lake and South Gap Lake. There is some moderate rock scrambling to get to South Gap Lake, but overall the trail is well-maintained.

If Sandra McCree's window were in a different office several stories down and all she could see was the grey or brown side of another building, she would've thought differently. She was fortunate to have the view. Well, she did work hard to get here, she quietly reasoned. She earned the view, though the persistent thought that she didn't belong here nipped at the back of her consciousness. Somehow, she had succeeded but didn't quite see how she had earned her success.\n\nThe afternoon had been crawling along. The energy of the day matched the thick blanket of low, grey clouds that coated everything in cold, persistent rain. It was the kind of damp chill that clung to your bones and threatened to snuff out the body's warmth. It was not a day where much work got done. Sandra felt sleepy and wrapped herself tighter in her draped sweater. She watched the boats travel down the river and thought of how cold and miserable it must be to be on one of them in this weather. She thought of her commute home. She had been dreading it but felt less sorry for herself after seeing the boats and thinking about having to work in the rain all day.\n\nSandra stood at the window and watched the boats a bit longer, though not actually seeing them. Her mind had wandered to that conversation she had had with Bill. It had not gone well. Then again, she hadn't anticipated that it would.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Eisenhower created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by signing the National Aeronautics and Space Act on July 29, 1958. Assets and research programs previously administrated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) were transferred to NASA as part of the act.\n\nThe creation of NASA was a response to the USSR's launch of a series of Sputnik satellites. The USSR launched the first Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957. This launch is generally recognized as the start of the Space Age. It also officially began the Space Race between the USSR and the United States of America.\n\nThe United States of America initially saw NASA and the Space Race as a matter of national security. Whoever controlled space would have the high ground in the event of a conflict. At the time, the USSR and USA were locked in the Cold War, a political and ideological rivalry between the two superpowers.\n\nNASA was given the task of developing the space capabilities of the United States, including creating the capacity to launch living organisms and hardware into space. Early efforts to launch organisms into space included launching two monkeys named Able and Baker on a suborbital flight on May 28, 1959. Both monkeys survived, though Able died two years later and Baker spent most of her life on display after the flight. NASA's Mercury Program also launched chimpanzees on test flights before sending astronauts.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, NASA conducted the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs, which taught many valuable lessons about conducting space missions that it still uses. Apollo sent crews to the Moon for the first time during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nWhile the Cold War ended with the collapse of the USSR, NASA continues to conduct scientific research in space and conduct its crewed space programs. It is currently a partner in the International Space Station and is preparing to return astronauts to the Moon with the Artemis Program.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

For first-time owners, the pet choice will depend on their interests, budget, and resources, as well as what kind of animal they feel comfortable with. Here are a few animals perfect for first-time pet owners:\n\n1. Dogs: Dogs are the ideal choice for most animal lovers. Although dogs can be a handful and they can take a fair amount of time to train, there's no doubt that they're loyal and wonderful companions. Golden retrievers and poodles are good breeds for first-time owners as they're generally easy to take care of.\n\n2. Cats: A beloved icon of the pet world, cats are known to be quite independent and extroverted as they can easily stroll around the neighborhood and find their way back to you. Take note that cats use litter boxes so you have to clean up after them regularly.\n\n3. Hamsters: If you're looking for something small and manageable, hamsters are the perfect pet choice for you. They're usually harmless and easy to maintain with no risk of aggressive behavior or unhealthy habits.\n\n4. Rats: Although rats can be intimidating for most people, they make great pets as long as you treat them gently and carefully. They do have some defense mechanisms that you'll have to get used to, but they're generally pretty calm and friendly creatures that you can easily get along with.\n\n5. Fish: Fish can make great pets as long as you maintain a safe boundary for them. Their tank or aquarium should be well-built, regularly cleaned, and placed at a suitable location where it doesn't easily fall over. \n\nOverall, owning a pet is a great way to showcase your passion for nature and wildlife, while giving you a fulfilling sense of attachment and responsibility. It's best to explore your options and determine what kind of pet would be best suitable for your house.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

","role":"user"},{"content":"What felt like a normal day abruptly became layered with a thick fog slowly engulfing the streets. David began scrolling through social media for people posting similar experiences, and he found no shortage of pictures, videos, and news articles depicting the unprecedented event. People from New York, Los Angeles, and even overseas in cities like Tokyo, Shanghai, and all major cities and areas around the globe were alerted by a slow-moving fog engulfing the surrounding areas. \n\nAs David continued to scroll through his phone, he heard what sounded like a loud, gargled screech coming from the street. It was tough to make out exactly what made that noise through the fog, but it happened again and again. The screeching grew louder, and it sounded like it wasn't coming from a single source but multiple. David peered through his window without drawing attention to himself to see what was going on, and that's when he noticed a slow-moving horde of zombies stumbling and moving in a coordinated direction.\n\n\"This is it,\" he thought to himself. \"This is really the zombie apocalypse.\"  David had seen many movies and TV shows depicting a similar event, but experiencing one in real life was a totally different story. David snuck around his house, shutting off all the lights to not draw attention to himself. As David was preparing to shelter in his basement, a zombie made its way to his front door. After fumbling around David's porch, the zombie managed to push the button on his doorbell camera. \"Ding, Ding, Ding,\" a sound echoed from David's phone as well as the doorbell, and the horde turned their attention to David's house. Banging and tearing down his door, the horde made it into his house. David would soon join the horde as the newest zombie recruit, with his undoing being the purchase he thought would protect him most.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

If you try to break down the word for yourself, may conjure up an image of a special type of cleaning instrument in your head. However, this is far from what a rollmop is. \n\nIn this article, we will talk about what rollmops are and where they originated from. \n\nWhat Are Rollmops?\n\nA rollmop is a unique food that consists of pickled herring fillets that have been rolled into a cylindrical shape, stuffed with fillings, and fastened together with skewers before being stored in brine. Rollmop fillings typically include vegetables such as onion, pickled cucumber, and pitted green olives stuffed with pimento peppers. \n\nThe brine that rollmops are stored in traditionally contains water, vinegar, and salt, but can also contain a variety of other additives. These optional extras include sugar or other sweeteners, raw onion slices, peppercorns, and mustard seeds.\n\nWhere Did Rollmops Originate From?\n\nThe name \u2018rollmop\u2019 is German in origin, making it friendly for many English speakers. This food has been a staple in countries in Northern Europe since the medieval period. It also had a spark in popularity in Germany in the early 19th century and is currently served as part of a traditional German hangover breakfast.\n\nCurrently, rollmops are eaten in parts of Europe, South America, the United States, and Canada. Rollmops are also unbelievably popular in present-day Czechia and Slovakia.\n\nConclusion\n\nRollmops are not a food that will be suited to everyone\u2019s tastes. Especially for those who do not enjoy seafood, vinegar, or pickled vegetables, this dish may seem very offputting. However, if you\u2019ve never tried pickled herring, we encourage you to give rollmops a try! Although it may be a little bit of an adventurous choice, those who like to try new foods and experience new cultures can find everything they need and more in a simple rollmop.\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Switch to LED Lights \nAlthough LED lights may cost more than traditional light bulbs, they will help you save tons of money on your energy costs over time. Switching to LED bulbs is an excellent way to conserve energy and save on your electric bill. LED lights will not just help you save on your energy bill, but they can also help you save money on your overall lighting costs since they last at least 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. That means you will not need to replace your light bulbs as often. \n\n2. Do Not Leave Your Refrigerator Door Open \nWe all look inside our fridge as we decide what we want to eat. But did you know that doing so can cause you to waste a lot of energy? It takes more time for your refrigerator to cool back down after the doors have been open for several minutes. To eliminate this extra cost, try deciding on what you want to eat before you open your fridge doors to help reduce the amount of energy used. \n\n3. Keep Your Oven Door Closed \nIf you frequently open your oven door while cooking, it will take twice as long to get back to the cooking temperature. Instead of opening your oven door all the time, consider using an oven light if your oven has a window on the door that allows you to peek inside. \n\n4. Shut Down your Electronics \nOne of the easiest things you can do to help save on energy costs is to shut down your electronics when they are not in use. We all tend to leave our devices such as our TV and laptop on making it more convenient than waiting for it to boot up again. But leaving your devices on while they are not in use can contribute to your high energy costs. When we leave devices plugged into an outlet, they are still using power. This is something known as \"phantom power\". To help reduce your energy use and costs, try connecting everything to a power bar and turning that off whenever you leave the house. \n\n5. Decrease Energy Use During Peak Hours \nThese days, many homes are now equipped with smart meters that keep track of when you are using the most energy throughout the day. If you are interested in conserving energy, you should use most of your electricity during non-peak hours. By doing so, you will save as much as 10 cents per kilowatt. \n\n6. Make Use of Small Appliances \nIf you are cooking a small meal, you will want to make good use of your smaller appliances instead of firing up your large electric oven. Toaster ovens, electric skillets, air fryers, and other countertop appliances are now versatile enough to help you create a full-course meal without using a ton of energy. \n\n7. Wash Laundry in Cold Water Only \nIf you have any delicate items in your wardrobe, you may already know about the benefits of washing your clothes in cold water. Doing so can help your clothing last longer and the fabric is less likely to shrink. Another great benefit of using cold water while doing laundry is that it will help keep your electricity bill low. It is estimated that as much as 90% of the energy used by your washing machine is spent on heating your water. Therefore, many consumers have caught on to the benefits of using cold water to wash their laundry. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

It could also be providing food for deep-water fish because once the sargassum loses buoyancy, it sinks to the sea floor.\n\nThe problems that arise with this type of seaweed is that it builds up along beach shores and emits a gas that reeks of rotten eggs. The rotting grass emits hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic to humans and may cause respiratory issues. The leaves themselves contain arsenic, which is incredibly harmful if ingested or used for fertilizer. Therefore, humans should avoid large quantities of seaweed on the shoreline and also avoid swimming through masses of it.\n\nScientists are unsure what causes sargassum seaweed to bloom in larger than normal amounts. Algae growth is affected by sea currents and thrives on rich nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Human activities like fossil fuel production can dump these wastes into rivers which feed the oceans. So if these levels are elevated in a particular year, then it is likely the seaweed could be more abundant.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Coffee roasting and cultivation is thought to have originated in Yemen in the middle of the 15th century. To go from harvest to being ready to brew and drink, the freshly picked coffee beans need to go through several steps. \n\n1. Once harvested, the fruit (called a coffee cherry) is dried to around 11% moisture. In many places, the cherries are left in the dry sun for several weeks. \n2. After drying, the coffee beans are then hulled, or polished to remove the thin, silvery, outer coating and sorted by size and weight before being shipped around the world.\n3. The coffee is roasted once it arrives at its destination which usually occurs at temperatures around 550 degrees Fahrenheit before being quickly cooled and sent to consumers. \n4. Roasted beans are now ground down to different grades depending on how it is going to be made into coffee. \n5. The final step is to use the ground coffee to brew yourself a fresh cup and enjoy.

Budgeting - this is extremely helpful in gaining an idea of your income and where you're money is going. It will also help you lay out any short or long-term goals you would have regarding your finances. A good rule to follow when it comes the budgeting is known as the 50\/30\/20 rule. What this means is you should allocate 50% of your after-tax income to expenses you consider essential, then you would want to allocate 30% to the things you want such as amenities in the last 20% should go towards your savings. \n2. Financial safety net - this practice will allow you to have money set aside for emergencies. Doing this will allow you to not rely on using a credit card for paying for major unexpected expenses. It's common practice to save about three to six months of your current living expenses to build that emergency fund.\n3. Paying existing debts - existing debt can be a major contributing factor to the drain on your finances especially when faced with high interest rates. It's a good idea to make a plan to know how long realistically it would take you to pay off any loans or debt you may have. Cards that have the highest interest rates are the ones you're going to want to prioritize making extra payments on. You'll want to make sure you're only charging what you're capable of paying each month. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

I was aware of it previously, but I didn't look into it until today. This thing's pretty amazing, so let me tell you about it. It's a particle accelerator, and its job is to smash tiny particles together. It's built inside a huge underground tunnel that's 27 kilometers long. The tunnel is a closed loop though, it's not just a tunnel that goes 27 km away from the starting point.\n\nThe collider uses magnets and other arrangements to accelerate particles to nearly the speed of light. At this point, the particles are put on a collision course with each other and ultimately collide. The magnets I referred to previously have to be kept at a temperature of \u2011271.3\u00b0C. There are thousands of magnets in the collider, so it makes sense it's a long loop.\n\nOne thing that's amazing about the LHC is the precision with which it operates. It has to collide tiny particles into each other, so you can imagine trying to shoot two needles at each other from 10km apart and trying to make them collide \u2014 it's no easy task! The collider is operated by the wonderful people at the CERN Control Centre, and I'd encourage you all to learn more.

I had imagined strolling along the Seine, admiring the Eiffel Tower, exploring the Louvre, and tasting the famous croissants and macarons. But when I finally got there, I realized that Paris was nothing like I had expected. It was a huge letdown.\n\nFirst of all, the city was crowded and noisy. There were tourists everywhere, pushing and shoving to get a glimpse of the monuments and museums. The lines were long and the tickets were expensive. I had to wait for hours to get into the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, only to find out that half of the paintings were on loan or under restoration. The Arc de Triomphe was surrounded by traffic and pollution, and the view from the top was not worth the climb.\n\nSecondly, the city was dirty and smelly. There was trash on the streets, graffiti on the walls, and dog poop on the sidewalks. The metro was dark and dingy, and the trains were often delayed or canceled. The hotels were small and shabby, and the beds were uncomfortable. The bathrooms were tiny and moldy, and the showers were either scalding or freezing.\n\nThirdly, the city was rude and unfriendly. The locals were snobbish and arrogant, and they looked down on me for not speaking French. They rolled their eyes when I asked for directions or menus in English, and they ignored me when I said hello or thank you. The waiters were slow and surly, and they charged me extra for water or bread. The shopkeepers were pushy and dishonest, and they tried to rip me off with high prices or fake products.\n\nI was so disappointed by Paris that I decided to cut my trip short and go back home. I felt like I had wasted my time and money on a city that did not live up to its reputation. I realized that Paris was not for me, and that I would never return. Paris may be a popular tourist attraction, but it is not a pleasant destination.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

So, one day when Ardel stumbled upon the smallest of holes in the enclosure fencing, it was no surprise that away he went. \n\nBut Ardel wandered too far from home this time and found himself in a strange new place - Chicago! He had never seen anything like the tall buildings and bright lights before. As he wandered around the city, he felt new emotions - he was lost and scared. But then he saw something kind of familiar - a statue of a cow! It was the famous Cow on Parade statue and reminded him of home. This made him relax a bit and Ardel explored the city for hours. He came across many of the famous landmarks in Chicago, like a cool shiny ball, the Willis Tower, and the colorful Navy Pier. He even stopped by to visit some of the animals at the Lincoln Park Zoo. \n\nBut as the days passed, Ardel started to feel homesick. He missed his cozy burrow and the warm sun of The Wilds. He longed to return home.\n\nArdel grabbed a piece of delicious Chicago-style pizza (they didn't have termite flavored) and wandered over to the Shedd Aquarium to think. Watching the penguins frolic in the Oceanarium relaxed him. \n\nWhile he was there, a kind family noticed him and they took him in and gave him a warm place to stay. They wanted to get him home to Africa but called The Wilds Preserve for some advice. They found out that Ardel was from there! \n\nSo the kind family took Ardel back to The Wilds. He said goodbye and knew he'd never forget his adventure in Chicago.

{"prompt":"Classify a series of wine descriptions as red, white or ros\u00e9. \n\nwine descriptions:\n1. Pull out this ros\u00e9 at your next weekend barbecue, and prepare to feel popular. A lesson in balance, this highly aromatic blend from Goose Ridge in Washington State delivers bright berry fruit and refreshing acidity, followed by a creamy finish. \n2. Cooler weather doesn\u2019t have to mean kissing your favorite crisp whites goodbye. Weighty enough to hold its own alongside rich foods and warming enough to deserve a place on your holiday table, this bottle is the perfect cool-weather white. Made from the lesser-known Greek white variety Aidani, expect notes of earthy sage and fennel alongside aromas of flint and struck matches. \n3. Craving red wine on a hot summer day? Say hello to this porch sipper. A 90 percent carbonically macerated red blend, it\u2019s highly chillable, with notes of rooibos tea, bright cherries, and a drizzle of balsamic. The sustainably grown melange includes Nebbiolo, Primitivo, Syrah, Tempranillo, and more. On the palate, sweet fruity notes take a backseat to structured tannins, keeping everything in balance.\n4. A sip of Grecian history, Mylonas Ros\u00e9 offers a unique blend of two native grapes: Malagousia and Mandilaria. The resulting wine boasts slightly earthy flavors, with accents of honeysuckle and Camembert rind. This bottle especially shines alongside food, from green salads to cheese plates. \n5. Think all red blends taste the same? Think again. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Petit Verdot combine to create distinct, structured notes of juicy strawberries and freshly cracked black pepper in this stellar bottling. Prominent tannins make for a slightly drying palate, but well-integrated fruit and acid keep things ultra-drinkable. Far from homogenized, this unique Napa Valley melange highlights how complex and well balanced red blends can be.\n6. With ripe berries, cream aromas, and vibrant acidity, it\u2019s not hard to see why ros\u00e9s made from Pinot Noir continue to gain traction in the States. From Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley, home to some of the country\u2019s best Pinot Noirs, Stoller Family Estate\u2019s take on pink wine is juicy and refreshing, with enough complexity to grip the palate and pique your interest. \n7. Equally as fun as it is \u201cserious,\u201d this chillable red is a definite crowd-pleaser. It\u2019s from Burgenland, a region in eastern Austria known for its full-bodied reds. For the Gamay lover looking to expand their horizons, this cool kid-approved bottle offers juicy, jammy vibes via an unexpected grape blend: Zweigelt and St. Laurent. A subtly tannic, slightly peppery red, it offers just enough sweetness to keep you coming back for the next sip. \n8. A supple Dolcetto that drinks like a highly expressive Merlot, this soft and juicy red is bursting with aromas of ripe blackberries, damp soil, and blueberry jam. From Massolino, a winery that\u2019s been producing high-quality releases in Italy\u2019s Piedmont region since 1896, this bottling is well structured and drinks like high-end Bordeaux blend, making its $20 price tag even more of a welcome surprise.\n9. Bernard Baudry\u2019s Chinon Les Granges arrives on the savory end of the red wine spectrum. Wafts of roasted red peppers and a bright hint of capsicum deliver everything we seek in Chinon, and more. The family-owned winery grows grapes across 79 acres in the famous Loire Valley appellation, producing a range of terroir-driven Cabernet Francs and Chenin Blancs. This wine was made to be drunk young and paired with aromatic, meaty meals like spaghetti bolognese or herb-crusted rack of lamb. \n10. Crafted as an homage to Madame Clicquot, who famously stated, \u201cOur black grapes give the finest white wine,\u201d the La Grande Collection is Veuve Clicquot\u2019s celebration of the Pinot Noir grape in all of its elegance. A blend of 90 percent Pinot Noir and 10 percent Chardonnay grapes from eight of Veuve Clicquot\u2019s historic grand crus, this bottle has an aging potential of 15 years. Rich brioche notes emerge on the palate without overpowering subtle tropical candied pineapple aromas. On the palate, fine effervescence and stunning acidity keep things light and mineral-driven. This is a lively and highly age-worthy bubbly that\u2019s sure to make any occasion feel special.\n11. A celebration of an extremely versatile native Greek grape, this bubbly pink wine is as easy on the palate as it is on the eyes. From the tiny town of Amyndeon in the Macedonia region, Kir-Yanni\u2019s sparkling ros\u00e9 is made from 100 percent Xinomavro, resulting in an ultra-vibrant, almost red hue that nears that of Lambrusco.

Pull out this ros\u00e9 at your next weekend barbecue, and prepare to feel popular. A lesson in balance, this highly aromatic blend from Goose Ridge in Washington State delivers bright berry fruit and refreshing acidity, followed by a creamy finish. \n2. Cooler weather doesn\u2019t have to mean kissing your favorite crisp whites goodbye. Weighty enough to hold its own alongside rich foods and warming enough to deserve a place on your holiday table, this bottle is the perfect cool-weather white. Made from the lesser-known Greek white variety Aidani, expect notes of earthy sage and fennel alongside aromas of flint and struck matches. \n3. Craving red wine on a hot summer day? Say hello to this porch sipper. A 90 percent carbonically macerated red blend, it\u2019s highly chillable, with notes of rooibos tea, bright cherries, and a drizzle of balsamic. The sustainably grown melange includes Nebbiolo, Primitivo, Syrah, Tempranillo, and more. On the palate, sweet fruity notes take a backseat to structured tannins, keeping everything in balance.\n4. A sip of Grecian history, Mylonas Ros\u00e9 offers a unique blend of two native grapes: Malagousia and Mandilaria. The resulting wine boasts slightly earthy flavors, with accents of honeysuckle and Camembert rind. This bottle especially shines alongside food, from green salads to cheese plates. \n5. Think all red blends taste the same? Think again. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Petit Verdot combine to create distinct, structured notes of juicy strawberries and freshly cracked black pepper in this stellar bottling. Prominent tannins make for a slightly drying palate, but well-integrated fruit and acid keep things ultra-drinkable. Far from homogenized, this unique Napa Valley melange highlights how complex and well balanced red blends can be.\n6. With ripe berries, cream aromas, and vibrant acidity, it\u2019s not hard to see why ros\u00e9s made from Pinot Noir continue to gain traction in the States. From Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley, home to some of the country\u2019s best Pinot Noirs, Stoller Family Estate\u2019s take on pink wine is juicy and refreshing, with enough complexity to grip the palate and pique your interest. \n7. Equally as fun as it is \u201cserious,\u201d this chillable red is a definite crowd-pleaser. It\u2019s from Burgenland, a region in eastern Austria known for its full-bodied reds. For the Gamay lover looking to expand their horizons, this cool kid-approved bottle offers juicy, jammy vibes via an unexpected grape blend: Zweigelt and St. Laurent. A subtly tannic, slightly peppery red, it offers just enough sweetness to keep you coming back for the next sip. \n8. A supple Dolcetto that drinks like a highly expressive Merlot, this soft and juicy red is bursting with aromas of ripe blackberries, damp soil, and blueberry jam. From Massolino, a winery that\u2019s been producing high-quality releases in Italy\u2019s Piedmont region since 1896, this bottling is well structured and drinks like high-end Bordeaux blend, making its $20 price tag even more of a welcome surprise.\n9. Bernard Baudry\u2019s Chinon Les Granges arrives on the savory end of the red wine spectrum. Wafts of roasted red peppers and a bright hint of capsicum deliver everything we seek in Chinon, and more. The family-owned winery grows grapes across 79 acres in the famous Loire Valley appellation, producing a range of terroir-driven Cabernet Francs and Chenin Blancs. This wine was made to be drunk young and paired with aromatic, meaty meals like spaghetti bolognese or herb-crusted rack of lamb. \n10. Crafted as an homage to Madame Clicquot, who famously stated, \u201cOur black grapes give the finest white wine,\u201d the La Grande Collection is Veuve Clicquot\u2019s celebration of the Pinot Noir grape in all of its elegance. A blend of 90 percent Pinot Noir and 10 percent Chardonnay grapes from eight of Veuve Clicquot\u2019s historic grand crus, this bottle has an aging potential of 15 years. Rich brioche notes emerge on the palate without overpowering subtle tropical candied pineapple aromas. On the palate, fine effervescence and stunning acidity keep things light and mineral-driven. This is a lively and highly age-worthy bubbly that\u2019s sure to make any occasion feel special.\n11. A celebration of an extremely versatile native Greek grape, this bubbly pink wine is as easy on the palate as it is on the eyes. From the tiny town of Amyndeon in the Macedonia region, Kir-Yanni\u2019s sparkling ros\u00e9 is made from 100 percent Xinomavro, resulting in an ultra-vibrant, almost red hue that nears that of Lambrusco. A refreshing sip with notes of strawberries and hints black licorice, this sub-$20 sparkler is fruit-forward with high acidity and a faint perception of sweetness on the palate. Its active bubbles tickle the tongue and keep the wine light, bright, and ripe for fried food pairings.

What are six ways that I can rev my brain and be more \u201cawake\u201d in the am?","role":"user"},{"content":"Not everyone is an early bird, but many night owls still have AM responsibilities. Here are six ways to rev up your brain to feel more alert and attentive in the mornings when it\u2019s hard to get out of bed! \n\n1. Take a cold shower with revitalizing scents to jolt your nervous system! \n\nMost people don\u2019t want to get out of the warm embrace of their blankets, so a cold shower may take time to work up to. The cold water is an immediate wake-up call to your nervous system, but a lukewarm shower with revitalizing scents in shampoo and body wash can be just as effective. The best scents for alertness are spicy or have citrus notes, such as orange, cinnamon, rosemary, and peppermint. \n\n2. Avoid the allure of sugary cereals and other sweet breakfast foods. \n\nWhile it may be tempting to grab a doughnut and a Frappuccino on the way to work, resist the urge. Sweet breakfasts will increase your blood sugar, which can make you feel alert for a few hours before a hard crash of fatigue in the afternoon. \n\nStick to a hearty, healthy breakfast with protein and heart-healthy fats instead. Eggs and bacon are a classic, but you could also blend a smoothie, have a slice of avocado toast, or opt for rolled oats with berries and a glass of whole milk. \n\n3. Drink a glass of ice-cold water before your morning cup of coffee. \n\nMany people can\u2019t wait to have their cup of coffee in the mornings but steer clear until you\u2019ve awakened your mind and body with a cold glass of water. Dehydration is a common cause of fatigue, so a glass of cold water will refresh your nervous system to get you moving in the AM. \n\n4. Listen to something upbeat, like a comedic, engaging podcast or your favorite \u201cget up and go\u201d music. \n\nPutting yourself in a good \u201cgo-getter\u201d mood will help you awaken your senses in the mornings. Upbeat music or laughter are both great ways to help you feel more alert and prepped to take on the day. \n\n5. Stretch and work out fatigue with a quick walk outdoors. \n\nNot only will a good stretch and regular exercise help you sleep better, but a quick stroll outdoors in the morning is a change of scenery that tells your body and mind that it\u2019s time to wake up for the day. Slow stretches work out kinks that accumulate in muscles while asleep.\n\n6. Allow natural sunlight to permeate your surroundings in the mornings. \n\nThis one may make you groan with dread, but sunshine suppresses melatonin production within your body. Melatonin is the chemical that makes you sleepy, and that\u2019s encouraged in dark environments. Standing in sunlight for a few minutes after you wake up tells your mind and body that the day is getting started. \n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Our universe is old but the dark is much older. We have trespassed upon its domain forgetting it is sovereign. On Earth, we believed the Devil reigned below -- in fire and brimstone, laughing. Only to soon find that he plays in the ether above -- basking in starlight, screaming.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Rhetoric is the act of persuading people in writing or orally to accept the writer\u2019s or speaker\u2019s argument as correct. Rhetoric uses three strategies to persuade: Logos, Ethos, and Pathos. In English, we know them as Logic, Ethics, and Emotion.\n\nPathos\/Emotion means to persuade by direct appeal to a person\u2019s emotions so that they feel what the author wants them to feel. To accomplish this, the author chooses words, examples, and stories that evoke emotion. The ensuing emotional responses such as anger, frustration, or amusement can lead people to become sympathetic to the author\u2019s position.\n\nLogos\/Logic means to persuade by direct appeal to a person\u2019s logical reasoning. To accomplish this, the author presents clear, logical connections between ideas, that are supported by facts and statistics or by presenting analogies. If the arguments presented contain unclear or erroneous assumptions in facts or analogic connections, known as logical fallacies, the argument can fail.\n \nEthos\/Ethics means to persuade by convincing a person of the author\u2019s inherent credibility based on the author\u2019s credentials and\/or the credentials of the sources of facts and ideas presented as part of the argument. To accomplish this, the author presents their own and\/or their sources\u2019 academic, professional, and\/or authorial history, details their personal experience as it relates to the issue, and demonstrates their complete understanding of the issue\u2019s complexities by using counter arguments to an opposing position.

Acting as a global conveyor belt, ocean currents transport heat from the equator toward the poles, helping to balance the Earth's temperature. This happens through a process called thermohaline circulation, driven by differences in temperature (thermo-) and salt content (-haline). Warmer, less dense water from the equator moves along the ocean surface towards the poles. As it reaches the colder regions, the water cools, becomes denser and saltier, and sinks into the deep ocean. This colder water then flows back towards the equator, where it warms up again and rises to the surface, completing the cycle. This process is critical for redistributing heat around the planet, and disruptions to it due to climate change could have profound impacts on global climate patterns.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Open QA"}

She was just about your age and had just finished the third grade. She loved to go to her grandmother's house in the summer, and one of her favorite activities was to play in the big barn her great-grandfather built before she was born.\n\nThe barn smelled like old hay and horses, even though there had been no horses there as long as Judith could remember. An old tractor was parked inside, and there were other things scattered around, like old leather harnesses, wooden buckets, and rusty chains. Judith would pretend each of the horse stalls was a room in her grown-up mansion.\n\nOne day, Judith was feeling particularly adventurous. She decided she wanted to see what was inside a room in one corner of the barn. The door to the room was held closed by an old padlock. Judith saw the padlock was not snapped shut. It would be easy to remove it and open the door!\n\nJudith was curious and couldn't wait to see what was inside. She easily removed the lock and dropped it on the ground with a thud, then she slowly pulled the old door open. The hinges squeaked, and her heart was beating fast. She was excited and a little afraid, but she couldn't wait to see what was inside.\n\nThe inside of the small room was dark, but some sunlight shone through the wooden slats of the barn wall, and she was able to make out the shapes of a shelf with old tools, some shovels and hoes propped up against the wall, and one big, cardboard box that was taped shut.\n\nThe box caught Judith's eye at once. She wanted to know what hidden treasures might be stored inside! The tape was loose from years of summer heat, so the flaps of the box opened easily. There was only one thing inside. It looked like a black stick. She grabbed one end of the stick to pull it out of the box and gasped when she saw a cloud of little, white stars come out of the other end! What kind of stick was this? Could this be a magic wand?","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Turn it up so you can hear it in other rooms!\n- Buy cleaning supplies that you enjoy: It might help to buy a new vacuum you've had your eye on or even a robot vacuum, but if you're looking to keep it inexpensive, find cleaning supplies with your favorite scents or rubber gloves in funky colors.\n- Make a game out of it: Divide up the bathroom cleaning into tasks. Cleaning the toilet, bathtub, and sink should all be separate tasks. Set a goal for yourself to see how quickly you can finish each task. Set a timer and try to beat each goal!\n- Listen to something: Nothing beats listening to music or even a podcast while you're cleaning. Immerse yourself in something interesting to make the time go by faster while you finish cleaning the house.\n- Reward yourself: Once you're finished, have a reward waiting for you.

A general rule of thumb is to allow at least four square feet of space per chicken. If your flock will have limited access to the outdoors, you should look at chicken coops that provide up to ten square feet of space per chicken. Built-in features like roosts and nesting boxes will make your chickens comfortable and encourage them to lay plenty of eggs. Adding a fenced run that is a great way to let your birds enjoy the outdoors while protecting them from predators.\n\nBuilding materials are another important consideration when shopping for a chicken coop. Avoid building materials that may rot, harbor pests or be toxic to chickens. At the same time, you want to choose a material that is sturdy and durable. Repurposed wood is perfectly acceptable if you're building your own coop, but you need to make sure that the lumber you use is treated to prevent wood rot and mold. Regulate the temperature and humidity in your coop by installing proper insulation and ventilation.\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Oil Paint - Oil paint comes in tubes that can be purchased individually or in a set. As you are new to oil painting, a set with basic colors is a good place to start. You will need tubes of white, black, red, blue and yellow.\n\n2. Brushes - As a beginner, you do not need many brushes, it is best to master a few basic sizes before branching out to more costly options. A variety of one or two small, medium, and large round brushes will be enough to begin with. \n\n3. Turpentine or Mineral Spirits - Oil paint does not require water for brush cleaning. Instead, you use a paint-thinning solution to clean excess paint from the bristles. Turpentine is a commonly used phrase for this substance, but mixtures of odorless mineral spirits are a common alternative. Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area as these liquids can be harmful.\n\n4. A jar for cleaning brushes - You will need a glass vessel with a lid to store your turpentine or mineral spirits for cleaning. Ensure the vessel has a secure lid to seal in the vapor when not used.\n\n5. Linseed Oil or Oil Medium - Much like mineral spirits and turpentine, linseed oil will dilute oil paint. However, as it is oil-based, it creates an ideal consistency without sacrificing the paint\u2019s texture when painting. You can use this in the same way you would use water to thin-down other paints, such as watercolors.\n\n6. Rags - Rags are used to wipe your brushes after cleaning once you have dipped them in your jar. \n\n7. Palette - You will need a clean, hard, non-porous surface to decant and mix your paint on.\n\n8. Painting Surface - Any surface can be painted with oil as long as it is primed with Gesso. The most common surfaces are canvas, thick paper, or wooden panels.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Here are some ways you can bond with your cat that don't involve them being too active.\n\n1. Treats: Treats are a great way to bond with your feline companion. You can use handheld Churo treats if you want your cat to come close to you, as many cats love licking those treats.\n2. Toy Mice: Although some toys involve cats running around a lot, toy mice tend to be better as your cat can play with them in one spot if they choose to. Sit on the floor with your cat and toss them some toy mice, encouraging them to play. You can also get toy mice that have squeakers or catnip, both of which will further encourage your cat to get involved.\n3. Petting: Petting is a great, underrated way to bond with your cat. Make sure you take note of where your cat likes to be petted. Most cats don't like being touched on their belly, but some love head scratches! You can test this out by gently petting them in different places and looking for signs that they do or don't enjoy what's going on. If they don't enjoy it, try switching to petting them in a different place.\n4. Catnip: Providing catnip is a good way to bring your cat close to you. Try putting some in objects that are near you, as they'll attract your cat to come closer.\n5. Give Them Space: Believe it or not, giving your cat space can be a great way to bond with a skittish cat. Some cats would prefer to come to you rather than you coming to them, especially if they're new to your household. Chill near them, but don't force them to interact, and you might notice it's not long before your cat is sliding closer and warming up to you.\n\nRemember that all cats are different, so it's important to observe your cat's personality and learn their likes and dislikes. By doing this, you'll quickly find the best way to bond with them.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

He is a convicted serial killer, having murdered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He grew up in Bath, Ohio and developed a fascination with dead animals after his father removed one that had died under their house. He collected road kill and dead animals, and his father taught him how to preserve their bones. In high school, Dahmer developed a drinking problem and was a bit of an outcast. His parents separated shortly after he graduated and he ended up living alone in the family home. During this time he picked up a hitchhiker, Steven Hicks, and took him to the house to drink beer. After several hours, Hicks wanted to leave and Dahmer wanted him to stay and killed him. \n\nDahmer attended college for a short time and joined the Army. He eventually found his way back to Wisconsin. He committed his next murder in 1987. He killed 15 more men and boys. On July 22, 1991, he attempted to kill Tracy Edwards, but he escaped and went to the police. Upon a search of his apartment, they discovered the remains of multiple victims. He was arrested and confessed to the crimes. \n\nHis victims are as follows:\n- Steven Hicks, age 18, June 18, 1978\n- Steven Tuomi, age 25, November 20, 1987\n- James Doxator, age 14, January 16, 1988\n- Richard Guerrero, age 22, March 24, 1988\n- Anthony Sears, age 24, March 25, 1989\n- Raymond Smith, age 32, May 20, 1990\n- Edward Smith, age 27, June 14, 1990\n- Ernest Miller, age 22, September 2, 1990\n- David Thomas, age 22, September 24, 1990\n- Curtis Straughter, age 17, February 18, 1991\n- Errol Lindsey, age 19, April 7, 1991\n- Tony Hughes, age 31, May 24, 1991\n- Konerak Sinthasomphone, age 14, May 27, 1991\n- Matt Turner, age 20, June 30, 1991\n- Jeremiah Weinberger, age 23, July 5, 1991\n- Oliver Lacy, age 24, July 15, 1991\n- Joseph Bradehoft, age 25, July 19, 1991\n\nJeffrey Dahmer was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on February 17, 1992.

With the original understanding that the country would eventually be reunified, the Allied Powers agreed to share the responsibility of administering Germany and its capital, Berlin, and each took responsibility for a certain portion of the defeated nation.

Having experienced great losses as a result of German invasions in the First and Second World Wars, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin preferred that a defeated Germany be dismembered and divided so that it could not rise to its former strength to threaten European peace and security again. At the Tehran Conference between U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1943, the two countries agreed that after the war Germany would be divided and occupied jointly. At the final wartime conference between these two men at Yalta in 1945, the two powers agreed to shift the eastern border of Germany to the West, enlarging western Poland as compensation for the eastern sections of that country annexed by the Soviet Union. They also determined that the occupation would divide Germany into sections, with each Allied power taking responsibility for one section, although they would be governed as a single economic unit in anticipation of their eventual reunification. Finally, they also concluded that they would demand reparations from Germany, although they did not yet agree on exactly how much they would request. A meeting later in 1945 between Stalin and new U.S. President Harry Truman held at Potsdam confirmed and ratified these arrangements.\n\nAfter the victory over the Axis powers, however, the wartime cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union soon faded.

Seattle clinched a Stanley Cup Playoff berth this season and advanced to Game 7 of the Western Conference Second Round, a 2-1 loss at the Dallas Stars. The Kraken went 46-28-8 to clinch the first wild card into the postseason from the West and eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche in seven games in the first round.\n\nSeattle finished 27-49-6, the third-worst record in the League, in its first NHL season.\n\n\"Every year is different; every year is unique.

Just a quarter day's travel south of the Ketturra Village, in a clearing in Ketturra Forest, a young carpenter found the child within the petals of a large lotus flower right in the center of a small pond. The man and his wife had been praying for a child for no less than five years. Seeing this as an answer to their prayers, the young man freed the child from the lotus flower only to find he had a jackal's head; however, the man was not put off by the child's strange appearance and brought him home. The wife of the young man also found great solace in finally having a child and felt no concern over the child's difference. They named the child Nubis, as they reasoned he had descended from the clouds, as a gift from the gods.\n\nAs Nubis grew into a man, the carpenter, and his wife noted that not only could Nubis speak and reason better than most other people in Ketturra Village, but he was adept at swordplay and fighting. Often, Nubis spoke of joining the royal guard of the Kingdom of Akhetua and training tirelessly with the local smith to hone his skills in swordplay. One day, Nubis packed his horse, Cabbage, and made his way to the capitol to submit himself to the trials meant to test would-be knights.\n\nThe first trial, meant to test one\u2019s strength, took place in the Colosseum, in which the contestant fought off several terrible monsters. Nubis completed the trial with ease, much to the surprise and delight of the royal court.\n\nThe second trial, meant to test one\u2019s mind, consisted of several puzzles, all of which Nubis again solved with ease.\n\nThe third and final trial, meant to test one\u2019s loyalty, required the contestant to obey the order of the king. Nubis was ordered to kill a man believed to be innocent without question. Unable to follow through with such a task, Nubis abandoned his quest to become a knight and chose to roam the world instead. Those who honored his display of character deemed him Nubis Wisefoot.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

It\u2019s the only vegetable oil that can be consumed just the way it is, freshly pressed from the olive. It contains many beneficial health effects. Consuming just two teaspoons each day can prevent heart disease and gallstones. Research has also shown that it can lower your risk of colon cancer. \n\nOlive Oil is a good cure-all for many afflictions. But it has also been used for many centuries in religious ceremonies. In the Roman Catholic church, for instance, olive oil has been utilized by Priests to perform a variety of ceremonies, such as baptisms, Confirmations, and even as fuel for lamps in their churches. \n\nDuring ancient times, olive oil was used to anoint a king during his coronation ceremony. In 1 Samuel 10, the mighty prophet of old Samuel uses a flask of olive oil to anoint Saul, the very first king of Israel.\n\nAlmost since time began, olives have been associated with peace. An olive tree cannot be grown in a hostile environment. It requires lush, fertile soil and arid temperatures. Even then, it will take several years before the olive tree can produce fruit. But once it does, this amazing tree can live for up to 500 years. \n\nOlive trees have an almost titanic resistance, a vital force that renders them nearly immortal. Despite harsh winters and burning summers, despite truncations, they continue to grow, proud and strong, reaching towards the sky, bearing fruit that nourishes and heals, inspires, and amazes.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

In Sootsprite's mind, the world was meant to be explored.\n\nThe other kitten was a bit of a princess. She was fluffy and preferred to sit on a cozy windowsill and watch the world go by. Her fur was gray, and her name was Malarkey. She didn't like to get in trouble because she knew if she was bad, she would get sprayed with a squirt bottle.\n\nOne sunny day, Sootsprite's and Malarkey's human roommate left to go somewhere. They heard talking in excited voices. The man took his car keys and held the door open for a woman. \"You be good now,\" he said, looking right at Sootsprite. \"I'm counting on you to not make a mess.\"\n\nMalarkey looked back and forth between the man and Sootsprite. \"Oh no,\" she thought. \"This could be bad.\"\n\nSure enough, as soon as he heard the keys turn in the lock, the little black cat jumped up from the couch. He ran to the window, pushing Malarkey aside and watched as a white car pulled away from the curb. He turned to Malarkey with a big toothy grin on his face. She stared back and shook her head.\n\nBut Sootsprite didn't heed her warning. He jumped down from the windowsill and ran into the kitchen.\n\nCRASH!\n\nMalarkey sighed and decided to go and see what he'd done. She stretched her back legs, then her front legs, and gracefully hopped to the couch, then the ground.\n\nBy the time she got to the kitchen, there were treats all over the linoleum. Sootsprite was on the top of the refrigerator -- a VERY naughty place to be. He peeked over the edge with his grin.\n\nMalarkey could smell the treats, and she felt tempted by their fishy shape.

Once the back of your seat is even with the rear bumper of the vehicle beside you, turn your steering wheel quickly and evenly towards the spot until your vehicle is at a 45-degree angle as it enters the spot. Be sure to look over your shoulder as you back up to make sure there's nothing in your blind spot. Perfect Roger, of course, can skip this step because he has no blind spots.\n4. Once your rear tire is about 18 inches from the curb and your front bumper is next to the rear bumper of the vehicle in front, start turning your steering wheel to the right to straighten the car up while still reversing. \n5. Once you're fully in the space, you'll likely have to center your vehicle in the space between the spots in front of you and behind you by moving your car slowly and carefully backward or forwards. Be careful not to scrape the other cars. Also, watch out for Perry the Platypus.\n\nCongratulations, by following these steps you have successfully parallel parked! You are now one step closer to conquering the Tri-State Area!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

The location's historical significance is tied to LGBTQIA+ history. On June 28, 1969, police stormed the gay bar and arrested multiple people. Patrons resisted and riots broke out between patrons and the police. The Stonewall uprising, as it was known, lasted six days and solidified a key moment in the LGBTQIA+ civil rights movement. Marsha P. Johnson, a self-identified drag queen and prominent gay liberation activist, was one of the most well-known participants in the event.  In 1999, The Stonewall Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was the first LGBTQIA+ location to appear on the register. In 2000, it was named a National Historic Landmark. The Stonewall Inn was designated a New York City Landmark in 2015, then a State Historic Site in 2016 - as part of the Stonewall National Monument.

The blinding glow of infernal lights illuminated the cursed domain, casting sinister shadows that danced along the walls. Demonic guards, with their razor-sharp horns and sulfurous breath, slammed their truncheons against the metal bunks, jolting the imprisoned souls from their fitful slumber. The air echoed with their spine-chilling screams as they bellowed orders.\n\nAmidst the clamor, the souls rose from their charred resting places, their eyes filled with a haunting despair. With trepidation, they lined up in their cubicles, their gazes fixed straight ahead, awaiting the morning count. The guards, grotesque demons with smoldering eyes, conducted the ritualistic inspection, ensuring the presence of every damned soul. Time seemed to crawl as the wretched captives shuffled through the dimly lit corridors, hurrying to the fetid latrines. In the absence of mirrors, they spared themselves the torment of seeing their wretched visages, their heads shaven clean, a stark symbol of their damned existence.\n\nClad in threadbare garments, the souls marched outside, braving the oppressive heat that enveloped the infernal realm. They converged with other platoons on the scorched parade grounds, a desolate expanse where their infernal punishments took shape. The platoon captain, a towering demon with bat-like wings, addressed the tormented gathering, his voice dripping with malice.\n\n\"Welcome to the training grounds of eternal suffering,\" the platoon captain snarled, his voice resonating through the sulfurous air. \"Here, you will endure physical torment that matches the depths of your sins. You will run, you will sweat, and you will learn the true meaning of despair.\"\n\nAs the platoon captain continued his diabolic sermon, the souls stood motionless, their minds clouded with a mix of fear and resignation. The captain recited a haunting mantra, a twisted creed of survival within the infernal abyss.\n\n\"In the fiery depths of Hell, there is no rest for the weak,\" the captain proclaimed, his voice echoing with sadistic delight. \"Every soul must strive to outpace their fellow tormentor or risk descending further into the abyss. Whether you be demon or damned, heed my words\u2014when the flames rise, you must run.\"\n\nAnd so, they ran. The main character, their spirit weary and broken, dragged themselves along, their every step burdened with the weight of their sins. The demonic guards, their monstrous forms towering over the tortured souls, barked commands and lashed out with fiery whips, their taunts and jeers fueling the captives' desperate resolve. The main character, their head throbbing with infernal pain, pushed forward, an embodiment of defiance amid the relentless torment.\n\nThe midday respite brought no reprieve from their anguish. Instead, they were subjected to another vile meal\u2014nauseating concoctions served on tarnished platters. The platoon captain, a demon of sadistic delight, introduced the \"Stripes of Shame\" with malevolent glee. The striped garments, adorned with hellish symbols of punishment, served as a constant reminder of their fallen status. The platoon captain's words dripped with venom as they explained the purpose of these garments\u2014to humiliate, degrade, and remind the condemned souls of their eternal damnation.\n\nChained and silenced, the souls were led like a procession of broken spirits, their striped smocks billowing in the sulfurous wind. They were herded into the accursed wagons, their limbs shackled to one another, their every movement restricted. It was during this treacherous journey, bound by the chains of their collective misery, that the main character encountered Julie Martin, a soul ensnared by her association with a wretched lover. \n\nThey found solace in their shared predicament, a glimmer of camaraderie amidst the labyrinth of damned souls.

Obviously, it's important to consider your knowledge, skills, and experience, but price yourself with what you are comfortable earning so that you will continue to be motivated to keep up your freelance writing business for the long term. \n\nHere are some simplified steps to help you set your freelance writing rates. \n\n1. Start with some online research. It's good to get a grasp on what people are paying in your industry or niche. If you don't have one, that's fine too! Seeing the differences in pay may be a factor to consider if you're thinking of choosing a niche. You can go to any of the freelance job platforms you're now a part of to see what clients are listing their budget as (even though it's not always listed), what other writers' rates are, and their level of experience\/background. \n\n2. Consider your professional and educational background. Even if you are new to freelance writing, any relevant experience can set you apart from others and provide a reason to charge a higher rate. This has its limits obviously, you must have the skill to back it up. If you have a degree in English or journalism, that sets you apart. Obviously, if you don't have a writing background or other credentials, this doesn't mean that you can't be a freelance writer, it just means that you may have to start at a lower rate until you have successfully completed a few projects and have some good reviews under your belt. \n\n3. Consider the budget of potential clients. It's important to know what clients you are targeting. If you want to take on a client with a startup business, they will likely offer lower pay because that may be all that's in the budget. If you target more established businesses or individuals to write for, there may be more room for negotiation on your rate or the project cost. \n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

What is its place in modern TV history?","role":"user"},{"content":"The Simpsons is the longest-running animated show of all time. It first aired on December 17th, 1989 on FOX and is still currently airing new episodes in 2023. Homer and Bart are two of the most iconic characters in the recent history of television. It has inspired many other shows in various ways, such as South Park, Family Guy, Beavis and Butthead, and many more.\n\nThe Simpsons is a modern interpretation of an everyday American family. Bart, the son, is a prototypical troublemaker with a knack for being much more intelligent than he makes people believe. Lisa, the daughter, is far above average intelligence and gets frustrated by the lack of others' intellect in the family. Homer, the father, is a working-class male who loves beer and works at the local power plant for minimal wages. Marge, the mother, is a housewife who loves her husband unconditionally and cares very much for her children's wellbeing. Maggie is the baby of the family and is almost always seen with a onesie on and a binkie in her mouth.\n\nWhile The Simpsons is most well-known for its longevity and iconic characters, the earlier seasons are peppered with insights into adolescent struggles and triumphs as well as the struggles that parents go through while navigating raising children and trying to maintain a healthy relationship like Homer and Marge do. Homer and Marge truly love each other, but the show isn't afraid to reveal that their marriage isn't always perfect and is often hard work. Self-deprecation from Homer is a part of most episodes, and the relationship between Bart and Homer is closer to that of a friendship than father and son.\n\nPart of the charm of The Simpsons is how unique and realistic the plots tend to be.  Many shows today still aren't willing to explore what The Simpsons were doing in the early 90s. The Simpsons have also correctly predicted many things that happened after the episodes aired, such as Donald Trump becoming president, the invention of smartwatches, and FaceTime. These are just a few examples.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Garfield springs from the pen and imagination of Jim Davis who named the big orange-striped cat after his grandfather, James Garfield Davis. Garfield reluctantly shares his home with his human, Jon Arbuckle, and a sweet but gullible dog named Odie. Garfield's three biggest hobbies are taking frequent naps, eating massive amounts of lasagna and sharing adventures with Odie. \n\nSpoiled, clever and more than a little cunning, Lucifer from Disney's Cinderella is our second favorite cartoon cat. His mommy, Lady Tremaine, makes no secret that Lucifer is her favorite and treats the big cat like a king. However, Lucifer isn't above tormenting Lady Tremaine's daughters or her step-daughter, Cinderella, and occasionally Lady Tremaine herself. The fluffy black cat's face, often set in a sneer, turns into a sinister grin when he's being very naughty!\n\nLast but by no means least on our list is three-time Academy Award winner Sylvester J.

I live in Idaho and want plants that grow well in this climate. I also want plants that are resilient to weather changes and take minimum effort to grow.","role":"user"},{"content":"Thank you for your question! I have found some garden plants that match your request.\n\n1. Lettuce: Lettuce does well in Idaho because it can withstand frost fairly well. It is also low maintenance, requiring little watering and can grow in any type of soil. It doesn't require a lot of space, so it is great for any garden size.\n2. Peas: You don't have to worry about the interaction of peas and other plants. They grow well among all plants and don't hinder the health of other plants. They thrive in cooler temperatures, meaning you can plant them early in Idaho and harvest them into late fall. They don't need much space and are a relatively hardy plant.\n3. Tomatoes: Tomatoes produce well in Idaho's summer climate, making them low maintenance. They can also do well even if planted in low-quality soil. They will need a stake or vegetable cage for support and to keep the wind from damaging them.\n4. Green Beans: Beans do well in Idaho summers because they are drought resistant, needing little water and doing well in direct sunlight. They also enrich the soil. Grow them once you're sure the risk of spring frost is gone. They do well growing up poles, meaning they don't need a lot of room.\n\nAll gardens require some amount of work, but these plants should be relatively easy to cultivate in Idaho. Good luck with your gardening endeavors!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Creepy dolls have been a staple of horror movies and cult fascination for centuries, but this fascination also has a real-life impact on society. From antique dolls with vacant expressions to modern eerily lifelike dolls that talk and move, these toys have the power to evoke strong emotions. While some may find them charming or collectible, others don't. I find them to be a true danger to society and a horror for some.\n\nFirst and foremost, utilizing a child's toy as an object of fear is simply uncalled for. Children are often afraid of the dark, and when they are given a doll that seems to be watching them and looks terrifying, it can be traumatizing. This can create phobias and anxieties, and negatively impact a child's psychological development and mental health. \n\nAdditionally, the fear of creepy dolls is not unfounded. Scientific studies show that humans can have an innate fear of objects that resemble human faces but aren't alive. This psychological phenomenon is known as the \"uncanny valley\", and it can cause feelings of discomfort and even revulsion in people. When a doll crosses this line and becomes too realistic, it can cause this genuine fear and anxiety.\n\nMoreover, dolls have a significant cultural history of being associated with possession. Voodoo dolls, for example, are believed to have the power to manipulate someone's fate and physical presence. Similarly, the concept of a doll coming to life and attacking is a common reoccurring theme in horror stories. This leads to a distrust of dolls and reinforces the fear that dolls could be used for nefarious purposes. In recent years, there have even been several instances where dolls have been used as part of hoax threats or pranks, causing unnecessary alarm and panic. \n\nIn conclusion, the risks and horrors of creepy dolls cannot be underestimated. Some find them harmless or entertaining, but others can experience genuine fear, anxiety, and psychological harm. It is essential to be aware of these risks and limit the use of creepy dolls, especially dolls intended for children. It is also important to recognize the cultural and historical significance of dolls and the joy they bring to people. Let's stop allowing the damage of creepy dolls and stop their creation and use now.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Keep a sleep schedule - Make sure you set aside no more than 8 hours for sleeping. The recommended amount of sleep you should get, for a healthy adult, is at least 7 hours per day.

Furthermore, if you aren't able to fall asleep within 20 minutes, leave your room and do something relaxing, like listening to soothing music. Do this until you find yourself getting tired.\n\n2. Be aware of what you eat and drink before bed - Don't go to bed hungry or overly full. Avoid having heavy or large amounts of food for at least a couple of hours before trying to sleep. Nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine are things you should be cautious about as well. Nicotine \n    and caffeine are stimulating, and the effects of that can take hours to wear off, which interferes with your sleep.\n\n3. Make a restful environment for sleeping - Keep where you sleep cool, quiet, and dark.

The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967) \n     Rating: 8\/10 \n     The first and most iconic album from the band, this release encapsulates everything that makes the Velvet Underground so great. \n     It is very experimental and the sound is very unconventional. Despite this, it is cited as the most influential album in Rock and Roll history. \n\n2.) White Light\/ White Heat\n      Rating: 6\/10\n      This is the second album released by the band.

{"prompt":"Make this story sound dramatic\n\nValediction\n\nAfter school, after football practice, every day for three years, John and I walked to the grocery store in our little town and bought candy, potato chips, and soda pop. It was a ceremony. We said hello to the old couple who owned the store, stepped into the walk-in cooler, grabbed our cold drinks, paid for them and our other snacks, and headed to John\u2019s house or mine, depending on what our parents were planning to cook for dinner.\n\nIt was an average life for two average kids.\n\nBut, one day, in November of our senior year, John and I, as usual, stepped into the cooler and grabbed our favorite cans of pop. But then we looked at each other and we both had the same thought. I don\u2019t know why it happened. Without saying a word, John and I grabbed three six-packs of soda and stuffed them into our duffle bags. Carrying the carbonated loot, we paid for our usual junk food, walked to John\u2019s house, raced into his bedroom and celebrated. We drank all that pop and got wound up and stupid on sugar and caffeine. We could have stolen beer but we were athletes. And jocks did not get drunk in our school.\n\nThe next morning, we met up before school, and vowed to never do it again. One time was kind of innocent, but more than that would be criminal.\n\nBut after practice that night, we did it again. Then again the day after that. We shoplifted for a week.\n\nThe thrill and guilt grew bigger each time.\n\nWe joked and laughed with the old people who owned the store. We paid for five bucks of snacks as we stole twenty more.\n\nThen I couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\n\n\u201cJohn,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to stop. We\u2019re going to get caught.

John had been caught shoplifting. I knew they\u2019d wonder how I was involved. John and I went everywhere together.\n\nHalfway through first period, I was summoned to the principal\u2019s office.

Candy, potato chips, and soda pop adorned our baskets, as if offerings to a forbidden sanctuary. It was a ceremony, a familiar dance etched into the fabric of our mundane lives. We exchanged pleasantries with the aging couple who presided over the store, disappearing into the chilled embrace of the walk-in cooler. Our hands grasped the icy allure of our chosen beverages, and with a nod of acquiescence, we sealed our fates. The transaction completed, our pockets weighed down by the weight of our guilty pleasures, we embarked on our respective paths, destined for either John's house or mine, dictated by the whims of our parents' culinary intentions.\n\nIn the realm of two average kids, our existence seemed defined by banality.\n\nBut then, one fateful day in the cold embrace of November, during our final year of high school, something inexplicable occurred. As we stepped into the cool haven of the store, our eyes met, and a silent understanding passed between us. The origin of that shared impulse eluded us, lost in the labyrinth of our subconscious minds. Without uttering a word, John and I seized three six-packs of soda, secreting them within the depths of our duffle bags. Laden with our ill-gotten carbonated treasures, we surreptitiously paid for our usual assortment of junk food, hastening to John's sanctuary or mine. In the sanctum of his bedroom, we reveled in our audacity. We consumed every drop of soda, surrendering ourselves to a tempest of sugar and caffeine-induced euphoria. We could have pilfered beer, yet our status as athletes forbade such indulgence. Jocks were not meant to succumb to inebriation within the halls of our revered institution.\n\nThe following morning, we reunited before the dawn of a new day, pledging to renounce our transgressions. One instance of juvenile innocence, perhaps forgivable, but beyond that threshold lay the realms of criminality.\n\nAnd yet, after that night's practice, we succumbed to temptation once more. And again the next day. Our shoplifting spree spanned an entire week.\n\nWith each passing theft, the intoxicating blend of thrill and guilt swelled within us.\n\nWe bantered and chuckled with the elderly store owners, masquerading behind the facade of innocence. We paid for a paltry sum of five dollars' worth of snacks while surreptitiously pocketing an additional twenty.\n\nBut then, a breaking point shattered the fragile equilibrium.\n\n\"John,\" I mustered the courage to speak. \"We have to cease this madness. We're risking everything. We'll be caught, expelled from the team, and potentially expelled from school.\"\n\n\"Just one more time,\" he retorted, his voice laced with reckless bravado. \"Come on, Pete. They're too feeble to apprehend us.\"\n\n\"I can't do it, man,\" I confessed, my resolve faltering under the weight of impending consequences.\n\n\"You've always been a coward,\" his words pierced my heart.\n\nAlone, I trudged the path homeward, while John ventured to the store. I anticipated a text or a call, a desperate plea for solidarity, a lifeline amidst the chaos. But the deafening silence persisted.\n\nAs I entered the hallowed halls of our educational institution the next morning, a gust of foreboding news greeted my ears. John had been apprehended, caught in the act of shoplifting. The inevitable questions followed. How was I involved? John and I were inseparable, two sides of the same coin.\n\nMidway through the first period, I received a summons to the principal's office. There, an assembly of authority awaited me\u2014 the principal, the superintendent, the school counselor, and the football coach. The room bore the weight of an imminent inquisition.\n\n\"Peter,\" the principal's voice reverberated, brimming with knowing authority. \"I'm certain you're aware of the reason for your presence here.\"\n\n\"Because of John,\" I answered, my voice a mere whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" he affirmed. \"Did you know of his actions? Were you complicit?\"\n\nThe truth beckoned, a gnawing urge within me. I understood the necessity of confession. Yet, the repercussions loomed, threatening to obliterate the life I had known. Did John already divulge the extent of my involvement, implicating me in a web of guilt? Did he do the honorable thing?\n\n\"Pete,\" the principal pressed, his gaze probing the depths of my soul. \"Were you an accomplice in this crime?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" I lied, the words a brittle facade stretched across the chasm of my deceit.\n\nThey scrutinized me, their piercing gazes unmasking my falsehood. They refused to let me escape unscathed.\n\n\"Very well, Pete,\" the principal declared, his tone laden with reluctant acceptance. \"John has already confessed to acting alone.\"\n\nI sensed the lingering doubt that clung to their minds, their unspoken suspicion of the truth. But in the absence of my confession and John's denial of my involvement, their hands were tied. John was banished from the football team, handed the penance of community service, and suspended from school for an agonizing month.\n\nDuring that interminable period of separation, we became strangers to one another. No calls, no texts. The unbreakable bond forged over years of camaraderie shattered. The weight of shame held me captive, preventing me from reaching out. I let John bear the brunt of the punishment, while I continued to play football, blissfully untouched by the spectacle of picking up litter under the scrutinizing gaze of our peers. I remained unsuspended, my reputation unscathed. Yet, an insidious undercurrent of betrayal crept through the whispers of some, as if John had betrayed me with his theft, nearly ensnaring me in the mire of his actions.\n\nWhen John finally returned to school, he averted his gaze, an impenetrable wall erected between us. And I mirrored his silent rejection. The void of our unspoken words persisted throughout the year, casting a palpable shadow over our graduation ceremony. Our parents mirrored our silence, their connection severed by the echoes of shame.\n\nUnder the cloak of darkness, amidst the revelry of a riverside kegger, we stood at opposite ends of separate campfires. Liquid courage coursed through his veins, while I abstained from its siren song. Intoxication marred his faculties, and in his altered state, he noticed my gaze fixed upon him. With a vehement motion, he hurled his beer into the fire, staggering toward me.\n\nHis fingers clenched my shirt, his grip a vice.\n\n\"You are not the person I believed you to be,\" his voice trembled with disillusionment.\n\n\"Nor are you,\" I retorted, our words a whispered lament in the abyss between us.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

With the line \"if x % i:\", you are checking to see if x is divisible by i. In the function's current state, if this check evaluates as False at any point (i.e. x is divisible by i, which is enough to determine that x is not prime), control gets passed back to the beginning of the for loop. This way the function only returns True if x is divisible by every value of i, rather than the other way around - the function should only return True if x is NOT divisible by any value of i. This can be easily fixed by modifying the divisibility test to \"if x % i == 0:\" or \"if not x % 0:\" instead. Additionally, to ensure the returned list is truly inclusive of both ends of the given range, you should adjust the range parameters in the return statement of the \"prime_numbers_in_range\" function to (a, b+1) rather than (a, b).\n\nThis is the revised code that implements the suggested solutions:\n\nfrom math import sqrt\ndef prime_numbers_in_range(a,b):\n    def is_prime(x):\n        if x > 1:\n            for i in range(2, int(sqrt(x)+1)):\n                if x % i == 0:\n                    return False\n            return True\n        return False\n    return [i for i in range(a, b+1) if is_prime(i)]\n\nFor a simpler solution to this problem, you can eliminate the need for a nested function by simply incorporating the test and result list in the \"prime_numbers_in_range\" function.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Coding"}

He managed to survive but was in a coma and would not respond to anyone or anything. His wife, parents, and children stayed at his bedside for many months hoping he would suddenly wake up, but with no guarantees and no time limit to how long a coma can last, it was anyone's guess when (or if) he would wake up. As time went by, the man's wife, parents, and children began to come to the hospital less frequently, until after one year they stopped visiting altogether.\n\nThen one day, five years later, the man woke up to the surprise of the hospital's nurses and doctors. It was a miracle that the man woke up, especially after such a long period of being in a coma, that they looked upon him as if he had risen from the dead. One of the nurses decided to call the man's family to inform them of the news. The man's wife, parents, and children rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news and smiled and cried tears of joy at the man's recovery.\n\nWhen they finally settled their emotions, they asked the man one of the most pressing questions anyone who had never been in a coma would ask: What was it like being in a coma?\n\nThe man contemplated this for several seconds despite already knowing the answer to the question; he wanted to ensure he was able to fully explain what the experience was like being in a coma. \"I had...dreams...very, very vivid dreams,\" he said, his voice cracking. As the tears started to stream down his face, he recalled the nature of his dreams.\n\n\"The last thing I remember is being in the train tunnel before being hit by the train. I saw a light at the end of the train tunnel, and it became really bright and struck me like a ton of bricks in the face. Then the light began to fade and recede back toward the end of the tunnel.

I've always tried to make the most out of my life as a doormat. For the longest time, I sat in a department store with my fellow mats, and they would say, \"Matt, you're such a great guy\" and \"Matt, you're one of the best.\" I felt like the best, too, beaming my \"Welcome\"  for everyone to see. I was a symbol of hospitality. Then, Jen and Dion took me home. They seemed like a great couple, and from what I heard, they were going to set up their new home for the first time.\n\nI remember how excited I was to cross the threshold and see that open space. Where, oh, where would they put me? Perhaps hung up on the front door to welcome guests or propped up on a table by the stairs. All I knew was that people would see me and feel welcomed into the home. At least, that's what I assumed. I was put on the ground while the couple explored the house; it was only temporary, of course. After the couple got over their giddiness of going through the entire home, they came back to the pile of boxes they'd brought in. \n\nThey both agreed to get started unpacking, but before they did, Dion picked me up. \"First things first,\" he said with a twinkle in his eye. This was it! He was going to put me in a place of honor. I was a little confused when I was unceremoniously dumped outside right in front of the door, right in the footpath of anyone entering or exiting the home. Did they not understand my peril here? The door suddenly swung open and Jen drove her high-heeled shoes straight into me. Dion was soon to follow, stepping outside and closing the door as they went to collect the rest of the boxes from the car. \n\nMy misery was only compounded over the next few weeks. The couple hosted a housewarming party. Hour after hour, guests traipsed in and out of the home, stomping on me without remorse. I was a tool to them, I realized then, resigned to my fate. Nothing but an accessory to be trodden upon, to wipe off the dust outside.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

{"prompt":"Turn the facts in this Wikipedia article about climate change into a series of questions with answers.\n\nIn common usage, climate change describes global warming\u2014the ongoing increase in global average temperature\u2014and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.\n\nDue to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[8] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.[9]\n\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result.[10] The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[11] Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming.[12] Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached.[13] Poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nMany climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 \u00b0C (2.2 \u00b0F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.[14] Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 \u00b0C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 \u00b0C (4.9 \u00b0F) by the end of the century.[15] Limiting warming to 1.5 \u00b0C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.[16]\n\nReducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, nuclear and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use. Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.[18][19] Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.[20]","prompt_id":"36d0620eb885e7e0cee42bd665b6db5b469116f0b2dbe40f7540015380d0d23f","messages":[{"content":"Turn the facts in this Wikipedia article about climate change into a series of questions with answers.\n\nIn common usage, climate change describes global warming\u2014the ongoing increase in global average temperature\u2014and its effects on Earth's climate system.

Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes.\n\n\nWhat are the causes of climate change?\nIt is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.\n\n\nWhat are the effects of global warming?\nDue to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather conditions.\n\n\nAre wildlife impacted?\nRapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. \n\n\nWhat are the effects on humans?\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming.\n\n\nIs it too late to stop the effects of global warming? Has the damage already been done?\nMany climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2\u00a0\u00b0C (2.2\u00a0\u00b0F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\n\n\nCan we learn to live with climate change?\nAdapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. \n\n\nAre poor countries affected?\nPoorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\n\nDo governments do enough? \nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2\u00a0\u00b0C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7\u00a0\u00b0C (4.9\u00a0\u00b0F) by the end of the century. In fact, limiting warming to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\nWhat can we do to cut emissions?\nReducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas-fired power plants, vastly increasing the use of wind, solar, nuclear and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use. Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.

We, the travelers from distant realms, were uneasy with this forced intimacy, our gazes vacant as we listened to the mountain unleashing its furious voice.\n\nThe taste of deep earth lingered in my mouth, its hot and rancid breath permeating the cramped space, seeping into my being. I felt myself melting away, as if transported back to a time before memory, when I awaited my emergence in the warm darkness of my mother's womb. Now, in this different womb, equally warm and dark, I awaited my escape. I shall not die.\n\nThe feeble light from a dimmed sun cast a yellow hue upon the desolate landscape, once vibrant and now blackened, dotted with the skeletal remains of the once lush forest. The earth trembled relentlessly, its vibrations shaking the very ground beneath our feet. Entire villages had vanished, and the majestic terraces we had embarked upon an arduous journey to witness were no more than a memory. Tales of the eruption circulated and grew with each retelling. We heard stories of premonitions\u2014a ghostly canoe drifting across the lake and prophetic warnings from a centenarian holy man who, it seemed, had vanished into thin air.\n\nHow long had I been imprisoned in this suffocating space? Day and night melded into one, as six spirits stood watch over me. With weathered hands, I explored the contours of my face, etched and pitted by the passage of years. These hands had bestowed blessings and curses alike. The now-chilly air bit deep into my skin, prompting me to wrap my tattered rug tightly around my shivering form.\n\nOur meager meals consisted of biscuits dipped in brandy, a feeble attempt to find solace in the face of uncertainty. Some of us, spurred by newfound bravery, ventured outside, only to hastily retreat as the earth quivered beneath our feet. Others, bolder still, ventured forth and never returned.\n\nThe fury of the earth's upheaval no longer surprised me. The signs had been there all along\u2014the relentless fluctuations of the lake and land, the spectral canoe gliding through morning mists. We deserved this.

We are a small business in Hawaii that makes a variety of cookies for any occasion. We have been in business since 2019 and continued to do business despite the pandemic, selling our cookies from home to local stores, businesses, and even online.\n\nSince 2019, Captain Cookies has sold a total of $300,000 worth of cookies to stores and businesses around the world. However, the number of cookies we make in our tiny kitchen cannot meet the overwhelming demand we have received recently due to a hugely successful TikTok campaign that came out several months ago and created a craze for our product.\n\nTherefore, we are now applying for a loan of $100,000 to help our business meet the growing demand for our cookies.\n\nBusiness Plan\n\nOur business plan involves the following:\n\n1. Leasing a new 1,000-square-foot warehouse building;\n2. Purchasing the necessary equipment (ovens, mixers) and packaging (plastic bags, twist ties, labels) to make and package 1,000 cookies a day, which would be an increase from the 200 cookies we currently produce from our current kitchen;\n3. Paying for utilities (electricity, Internet access for POS systems, and online sales).\n\n5-Year Plan\n\nThe 5-year plan for Captain Cookies will see our company expanding from a single kitchen to a larger warehouse kitchen that will accommodate the increase in demand for our cookies. Within the first year, we plan to start a business relationship with a large international coffee chain that operates from Washington State; this coffee chain has agreed to purchase 10,000 cookies for a first purchase order for one of their local stores as a test market, with the agreement to buy an additional 100,000 cookies if that particular campaign is successful.\n\nWe plan to do approximately $500,000 in sales by year three. By year five, we anticipate that with current sales, as well as the added relationship with the coffee chain and catering to a larger online market, we will do approximately $1 million in sales. We anticipate making our final payment on the loan before year four.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Look at last weekend's card and headliner which was Dern Vs Hill SMFH... then the upcoming piss-poor UFC fight night cards and I wonder what the hell is going on. Up until UFC 290 in July, there are like 1 to 2 fights max per fight night cards that I care for and I'm a diehard fan of the sport. The next PPV (UFC 289) card is just an abomination on so many levels with the only saving grace being Olivera vs Dariush. I would even go as far as to say the last Canadian card UFC fight night 158 Vancouver (2019) is better than the embarrassment that is UFC 289.\n\nI feel that the roster is just oversaturated to hell with so many middle\/low tier fighters who need to be cut as harsh as that might be and because of that the UFC are increasingly pushing quantity over quality to meet quotas, as they have to offer their fighters x number of fights a year. Speaking of UFC 290 which is in international fight week compare that card with UFC 239 card which was in 2019 (pre-covid) and it's just so, so much more stacked on every level, including the prelims, much more fitting for international fight week.\n\nEven UFC 276 international fight week last year compared to UFC 290 was just better in my view on paper (more compelling fights overall). Also before everyone jumps on me, UFC 290 is not a bad card (although why the f is Jack Della Madellena on the prelims) but each year I just feel the state of matchmaking declining further and further down with these shitty filler fight nights like last weekend.\n\nA lack of big-name stars committing to fights stuck in limbo (Conor, Khamzat, Jones etc etc etc), bigger-name fighters getting injured on PPV and the UFC moving them entirely instead of booking replacements (Thompson Vs Perriera as an example), no more triple champion cards (UFC 217 being my all-time favorite), ever-increasing PPV prices for less quality is just making the product dull.

Up until UFC 290 in July, there are like 1 to 2 fights max per fight night cards that I care for and I'm a diehard fan of the sport. The next PPV (UFC 289) card is just an abomination on so many levels with the only saving grace being Olivera vs Dariush. I would even go as far as to say the last Canadian card UFC fight night 158 Vancouver (2019) is better than the embarrassment that is UFC 289.\n\nI feel that the roster is just oversaturated to hell with so many middle\/low tier fighters who need to be cut as harsh as that might be and because of that the UFC are increasingly pushing quantity over quality to meet quotas, as they have to offer their fighters x number of fights a year. Speaking of UFC 290 which is in international fight week compare that card with UFC 239 card which was in 2019 (pre-covid) and it's just so, so much more stacked on every level, including the prelims, much more fitting for international fight week.\n\nEven UFC 276 international fight week last year compared to UFC 290 was just better in my view on paper (more compelling fights overall). Also before everyone jumps on me, UFC 290 is not a bad card (although why the f is Jack Della Madellena on the prelims) but each year I just feel the state of matchmaking declining further and further down with these shitty filler fight nights like last weekend.\n\nA lack of big-name stars committing to fights stuck in limbo (Conor, Khamzat, Jones etc etc etc), bigger-name fighters getting injured on PPV and the UFC moving them entirely instead of booking replacements (Thompson Vs Perriera as an example), no more triple champion cards (UFC 217 being my all-time favorite), ever-increasing PPV prices for less quality is just making the product dull. Instead of these BS fight nights cards I wish they would cut 1\/3 of the roster and do every month one solid PPV stacked from top to bottom like how it was trending towards before 2020 hit.\n\nSorry for the long rant but surely I'm not the only one feeling this way, maybe you guys have different views but I think it's becoming frustrating as shit being a fan of the UFC and my interest is just slowly being chipped away.","role":"user"},{"content":"Okay, I\u2019ll try to explain it simply. The post is about a sport called UFC1, which stands for Ultimate Fighting Championship1. It\u2019s a sport where people fight each other using different skills like punching, kicking, wrestling and more1. The person who wrote the post is not happy with the UFC because they think the fights are not very good or exciting lately. They think the UFC is making too many fights with people who are not very good or famous, and not enough fights with people who are very good or famous. They also think the UFC is charging too much money for people to watch the fights on TV or online1.\n\nThe person who wrote the post gives some examples of fights that they think are bad or boring. They use some words and numbers that might be confusing, like Dern Vs Hill, UFC 290, UFC 289, Olivera vs Dariush, UFC 158 Vancouver, UFC 239, UFC 276, Jack Della Madellena, Conor, Khamzat, Jones, Thompson Vs Perriera and UFC 217. These are all names of fighters or events that happen in the UFC23. The person who wrote the post thinks some of these fighters or events are better than others, and they wish the UFC would make more of them.\n\nThe person who wrote the post also says they are sorry for writing a lot, and they ask if other people feel the same way as them. They say they are big fans of the UFC, but they are getting tired of it because it is not fun anymore.

Here is an instruction manual on how to train like Bruce Lee:\n\nWeight training - Bruce Lee was a proponent of circuit resistance training, which involved doing circuits of exercises using weights. A sample circuit would consist of exercises that work out the entire body. For example, bench press, bicep curl, military press, squat, bent-over barbell row, and tricep extension using a weight about 60% of one's max 10 times per exercise, without rest, until all exercises have been completed would be considered a single circuit. Doing several circuits works muscles to build endurance, and also taxes the respiratory and circulatory systems.\n\nAerobic training - Bruce Lee loved his stationary bike; it allowed him to get an aerobic (at least 20 minutes of repetitive, low-impact exercise) workout while watching television or reading a book. If he was not using his stationary bike, he would go for a run of between 2-6 miles, with the runs changing the speeds and tempos during the duration.\n\nSkill training - Of course, as Bruce Lee would say, learning to fight from a book was like dry-land swimming; one needs to practice the skills that will be used in a fight. These skills mainly consisted of punching and kicking. The following is a list of skills that Bruce Lee practiced when developing his martial art of Jeet Kune Do: lead punch; uppercut; back fist; cross; hook; straight blast; front kick; crescent kick; roundhouse; front thrusting kick; instep kick; side kick; shuffling side kick; thrusting side kick. These are just a few of the techniques used by Bruce Lee, but while Jeet Kune Do teaches one to use any weapon that is appropriate for the situation, the simplest techniques are usually the best.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Affordable. \nMedellin is a very affordable place to live compared to other big cities worldwide. An apartment in Medellin will cost you about $600-$700. A meal out in Medellin will likely set you back around $3-$5 for a main, soup, and juice. A trip to the cinema will cost as little as $6 per person. \n\n2. Great weather. \nThe City is called the City of eternal spring. If you like nice weather, not too cold, Medellin is perfect as it's spring-like weather all year round. The city doesn't have high humidity; however, you can expect some rain during the rainy season. It will mostly rain for short showers in the afternoon. \n\n3. Learning Spanish.\nIf you want to learn another language, then Medellin is perfect for learning Spanish. Lessons in the city are usually well-priced, and you can expect a knowledgeable teacher to help you along. Spanish is the local language also, so you can get out and about to practice whenever you feel like it. \n\n4. Friendly local community. \nThe local people in Medellin are said to be very friendly and welcoming of tourists and ex-pats. Don't be surprised to hear a Buenos Dias from a passerby as you meander through the streets of Medellin. Be sure to be polite and courteous back using any Spanish you pick up. \n\n5. Large ex-pat community. \nWhile the local community is lovely and welcoming, sometimes it can be nice to be surrounded by compatriots and like-minded people. Medellin has a reasonably large ex-pat community with whom you can meet and tour the city together. Making friends in the town should be very easy for ex-pats. \n\n6. International food options. \nThe food in Medellin is delicious, and there are many local options to try. However, if you are searching for some home-country cooking, you can rest easy knowing Medellin has a wide variety of foods from around the globe. This is in large part thanks to the ex-pat community. \n\n7. Fast and reliable WI-FI.\nIf you are moving to Medellin and plan on working online or simply streaming movies, you will wonder about the WI-FI. In Medellin, internet connections are primarily reliable and fast. This will allow you to get on with your work before exploring.

The cold wreaked havoc on machines and travel was difficult, preventing widespread exploration.\n\nThe dawn light reflected faintly on the snow-covered peaks.

All over town, they were simply known as Yin and Yang because that is what they were, opposite forces. Matt was forceful, outgoing, and impatient while Pat's temperament was timid, shy, and overwhelmingly calm and steadfast. Being at opposite ends of the spectrum seemed to create the perfect balance in their relationship that they needed to work. This was never more evident than when they were inventing. It was Matt who was never afraid to try something new or as he put it, \"If you throw enough things against the wall, something is bound to stick\". This complete daring abandon to exploration had led to some of their best creations. But after a concept or process was introduced, it was Pat's gentle persistence and steadfast nature that slowed Matt down and kept him focused as they thoroughly investigated a new idea or change. Without this, Matt seemed to lack the patience for follow through and this made Pat's dedication equally crucial to their creative process. It was only their combination of daring and perseverance that made them so successful.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Violence is one of these topics and it appears in several different ways. The main characters are Sethe and Beloved, with Sethe being based on Margaret Garner. One day, the character of Beloved shows up at her home. Beloved seems to be a reincarnation of Sethe's child who died a very long time ago.

","prompt_id":"a0f2c83ce95152e83c827d58c00815c53de6a72bba63dca370b3f1a94d443503","messages":[{"content":"Provide some background about \"flow\" and ways and explanations I can achieve a flow state. ","role":"user"},{"content":"Sure! If you've ever gotten so consumed in a task that you forget about the outside world and completely lose track of time, you were likely in a state of flow. It may be commonly referred to as being \"in the zone.\" \u201cFlow\u201d and \u201cflow state\u201d are both terms frequently used in psychology and happiness research. Achieving flow is different than daydreaming, but activates the same part of the brain called the default mode network (DMN). The brain is relaxed when daydreaming, or doing nothing essentially. Interestingly, even though the brain is putting in thoughtful effort in flow, it is enjoyable and relaxing to the brain rather than feeling like work. It actually suppresses anxiety and frees up other parts of the brain to make meaningful connections. \n\nAs the understanding of flow increases, more and more people are looking to see how they can achieve flow. Here are some things you can do to set yourself up to flow: \n\n1. Set clear goals: First, it\u2019s important to have a defined goal involving the task at hand. A finite goal is more beneficial than a time-oriented goal, as it is more likely to emit a feeling of accomplishment once the goal is met, or the task is finished. \n2. Find things that are the right amount of challenging: If a task or activity is too difficult, it\u2019s hard for the brain to be relaxed enough to be in a flow state. However, the brain needs enough challenge for the brain to see it as interesting and engaging.  \n3. Create an environment for focus: This means doing what you need to do to eliminate distractions. This also includes carving out time to achieve flow where you know you won\u2019t be interrupted. \n4. Don\u2019t forget about self-care: Oftentimes in a flow state, people don\u2019t feel thirsty or need to use the bathroom or end up sitting in the same position for a long period that\u2019s not necessarily ergonomic friendly. In order to achieve longer-lasting flow states and take of yourself at the same time, invest the time or energy into getting set up right by doing things like having water readily available or sitting in a proper ergonomic chair. \n5. Put away your phone: This deserves a category in itself because our phones can be the biggest distraction. Turn it off, switch it on do not disturb, or keep it out of sight. Do whatever you need to do to not be tempted to pick up your phone. \n6. Develop a pre-flow ritual: This can involve a number of things like checking your email and messages before tuning in to your work or activity, putting on a designated playlist, doing jumping jacks, etc. It\u2019s more about whatever works for you to clear your mind and set you up for focus. \n7. Get to know yourself: It may take a bit of trial and error to find what works best for you to achieve flow. You can\u2019t enjoy everything, but you can make most things enjoyable by knowing what motivates you and helps you get into a state of flow. \n\nPsychology experts have determined that flow is associated with increased dopamine, which plays a huge role in regulating mood and motivation. It's also been determined that you can go in and out of flow and have multiple flow states per day, but 90-120 minutes is an optimal flow state for many people. It\u2019s good to want to achieve flow as often as possible in whatever you are doing for overall health and well-being. ","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

{"prompt":"Can you tell me the day on which construction of the Gerald Ford aircraft carrier began and when it actually got launched?\n\n\nConstruction\nOn 10 September 2008, the U.S. Navy signed a $5.1 billion contract with Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia, to design and construct the carrier. Northrop had begun advance construction of the carrier under a $2.7 billion contract in 2005. The carrier was constructed at the Huntington Ingalls (formerly Northrop Grumman) Newport News Shipbuilding facilities in Newport News, Virginia, which employs 19,000 workers.[19]\n\nThe keel of the new warship was ceremonially laid on 14 November 2009 in Dry Dock 12 by Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales. In a speech to the assembled shipworkers and DoD officials, Bales said: \"Dad met the staggering challenges of restoring trust in the presidency and healing the nation's wounds after Watergate in the only way he knew how\u2014with complete honesty and integrity. And that is the legacy we remember this morning.\"[35]\n\nThe ship's crest was developed jointly by the ship sponsor and the first commanding officer, Captain John F. Meier.[36]\n\nIn August 2011, the carrier was reported to be \"structurally halfway complete\".[37] In April 2012, construction was said to be 75 percent complete.[38] On 24 May 2012, the important milestone of completing the vessel up to the waterline was reached when the critical lower bow was lifted into place.[39] This was the 390th of the nearly 500 lifts of the integral modular components from which the vessel is assembled. Huntington Ingalls reported in an 8 November press release construction had \"reached 87 percent structural completion\".[40] By 19 December 2012, construction had reached 90 percent structural completion. \"Of the nearly 500 total structural lifts needed to complete the ship, 446 have been accomplished.\"[41]\n\n\nGerald R.

The time capsule holds items chosen by President Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales, and includes sandstone from the White House, Navy coins, and aviator wings from the ship's first commanding officer.[46]\n\nThe ship was originally scheduled for launch in July 2013 and delivery in 2015.[37] Production delays meant that the launch had to be delayed until 11 October 2013 and the naming ceremony until 9 November 2013,[47] with delivery in February 2016.[48]\n\nOn 3 October 2013, Gerald R. Ford had four 30-ton, 21 ft (6.4 m)-diameter bronze propellers installed. The installation of the propellers required more than 10 months of work to install the underwater shafting.[49]\n\n\nSusan Ford Bales, daughter of President Gerald R. Ford, christens Gerald R. Ford.\nOn 11 October 2013, the ship's drydock was flooded for the first time in order to test various seawater-based systems.[50] Her launch date was set to be on the same day as her naming ceremony on 9 November 2013.[51]\n\nOn 9 November 2013, the ship was christened by Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales, with a bottle of American sparkling wine.[6][52][53]\n\nAs of 2013, construction costs were estimated at $12.8 billion, 22% over the 2008 budget, plus $4.7 billion in research and development costs. Because of budget difficulties, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, warned there might be a two-year delay beyond 2016 in completing Gerald R. Ford.[54] The GAO reported that the price cap would be met by the Navy accepting an incomplete ship for that cost.[55]\n\n\nGerald R. Ford on the James River on 11 June 2016.\n\nGerald R.

In addition, construction was 93% complete as of September 2015.[56]\n\nIn July 2016, a memo was obtained by CNN from Michael Gilmore, the US Department of Defense's Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation indicating that problems with four major flight systems would further delay combat readiness of the ship. The ship was not expected to be delivered until November 2016 and these issues were suggested to further delay that goal. Construction of the ship was described as 98% complete, with 88% of testing finished.[57]\n\nBy March 2018, due to issues with the nuclear propulsion system and munitions elevators, construction costs had reached $13.027 billion, making the Gerald R. Ford the most expensive warship ever built.

The carrier was constructed at the Huntington Ingalls (formerly Northrop Grumman) Newport News Shipbuilding facilities in Newport News, Virginia, which employs 19,000 workers.[19]\n\nThe keel of the new warship was ceremonially laid on 14 November 2009 in Dry Dock 12 by Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales. In a speech to the assembled shipworkers and DoD officials, Bales said: \"Dad met the staggering challenges of restoring trust in the presidency and healing the nation's wounds after Watergate in the only way he knew how\u2014with complete honesty and integrity. And that is the legacy we remember this morning.\"[35]\n\nThe ship's crest was developed jointly by the ship sponsor and the first commanding officer, Captain John F. Meier.[36]\n\nIn August 2011, the carrier was reported to be \"structurally halfway complete\".[37] In April 2012, construction was said to be 75 percent complete.[38] On 24 May 2012, the important milestone of completing the vessel up to the waterline was reached when the critical lower bow was lifted into place.[39] This was the 390th of the nearly 500 lifts of the integral modular components from which the vessel is assembled. Huntington Ingalls reported in an 8 November press release construction had \"reached 87 percent structural completion\".[40] By 19 December 2012, construction had reached 90 percent structural completion. \"Of the nearly 500 total structural lifts needed to complete the ship, 446 have been accomplished.\"[41]\n\n\nGerald R. Ford sitting in drydock during construction.\nThe island was landed and accompanying ceremony took place on 26 January 2013.[42][43]\n\nOn 7 May 2013, the last of 162 superlifts was put in place, bringing the ship to 100 percent structural completion.[44][45]\n\nOn 11 July 2013, a time capsule was welded into a small room just above the floor, continuing a long Navy tradition. The time capsule holds items chosen by President Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales, and includes sandstone from the White House, Navy coins, and aviator wings from the ship's first commanding officer.[46]\n\nThe ship was originally scheduled for launch in July 2013 and delivery in 2015.[37] Production delays meant that the launch had to be delayed until 11 October 2013 and the naming ceremony until 9 November 2013,[47] with delivery in February 2016.[48]\n\nOn 3 October 2013, Gerald R. Ford had four 30-ton, 21 ft (6.4 m)-diameter bronze propellers installed. The installation of the propellers required more than 10 months of work to install the underwater shafting.[49]\n\n\nSusan Ford Bales, daughter of President Gerald R. Ford, christens Gerald R. Ford.\nOn 11 October 2013, the ship's drydock was flooded for the first time in order to test various seawater-based systems.[50] Her launch date was set to be on the same day as her naming ceremony on 9 November 2013.[51]\n\nOn 9 November 2013, the ship was christened by Ford's daughter, Susan Ford Bales, with a bottle of American sparkling wine.[6][52][53]\n\nAs of 2013, construction costs were estimated at $12.8 billion, 22% over the 2008 budget, plus $4.7 billion in research and development costs. Because of budget difficulties, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, warned there might be a two-year delay beyond 2016 in completing Gerald R. Ford.[54] The GAO reported that the price cap would be met by the Navy accepting an incomplete ship for that cost.[55]\n\n\nGerald R. Ford on the James River on 11 June 2016.\n\nGerald R. Ford underway for builder's sea trials on 8 April 2017.\n\nAerial view of Gerald R. Ford alongside USS Harry S. Truman.\nOn 23 September 2015, the Navy announced that several weeks of testing delays would likely slip the delivery date into April or May 2016. In addition, construction was 93% complete as of September 2015.[56]\n\nIn July 2016, a memo was obtained by CNN from Michael Gilmore, the US Department of Defense's Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation indicating that problems with four major flight systems would further delay combat readiness of the ship. The ship was not expected to be delivered until November 2016 and these issues were suggested to further delay that goal. Construction of the ship was described as 98% complete, with 88% of testing finished.[57]\n\nBy March 2018, due to issues with the nuclear propulsion system and munitions elevators, construction costs had reached $13.027 billion, making the Gerald R. Ford the most expensive warship ever built. Planned delivery to the Navy was delayed by three months, to October 2019.[58][59]","role":"user"},{"content":"The USS Gerald R.

That copy rushes them with inhuman speed, vaulting over the couch to reach Jun and his friends before they can escape. One quick slash from a knife is all it took to kill the three of them.\n\nAs Jun lay on the ground bleeding out, he held his friends' hands.

I believe, despite the price tag associated with building this lounge room, the increase in productivity will ultimately pay for it over a short time.\n\nRight now, employees have to leave the building to buy their lunches. Even after they purchased their lunches, they are either forced to eat in their cars or at the restaurants they bought their food from. Having a lounge would solve two problems: employees have a place to eat that is at their place of work, and if they chip in every month, the lounge room can be stocked with a variety of foods that can be prepared and eaten right in the room. Tardiness from clocking in late after lunch can be eliminated by having a lounge room in the building.\n\nI did some research and was able to determine that it would cost approximately $10,000 to build a new lounge room in the employee work area. This would cover the costs of building the room, as well as furnishing it with tables, chairs, a refrigerator, a microwave, a kitchenette, and vending machines for snacks and drinks. The company would be able to make up the costs by saving money on paying employees a meal allowance, as they would cover their own meals (either by chipping in to supply the lounge or bringing their own meals from home to eat). \n\nThis proposal is submitted for your review and consideration.\n\n- Employee","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

{"prompt":"My son is a very responsible twelve-year-old who is looking to earn some money this summer. He's not old enough to work at an establishment, so can you help think of some side jobs he could do and be paid in cash? ","prompt_id":"baf35d2cc9dd086590d8904b68ba3cca42aada872f711e9304e19fc5c6880cca","messages":[{"content":"My son is a very responsible twelve-year-old who is looking to earn some money this summer. He's not old enough to work at an establishment, so can you help think of some side jobs he could do and be paid in cash? ","role":"user"},{"content":"It's great that your son is hard-working and responsible. Here are some money-generating ideas that might help him:\n\n\u2022 Yard work: Many people have trouble taking excellent care of their yards throughout the season. The summer heat makes it difficult to maintain a yard's appearance, especially for the elderly. In spring, gardens will need to be tilled and flowers should be planted before the heat arrives. In summer, the grass grows quickly and most yards will need to be mowed at least once a week. Weeds grow continuously and will need to be trimmed or pulled.\n\n\u2022 Animal care: It's common for busy day-shifters to hire dog walkers to care for their dogs during the day and give them exercise and attention. It's also possible to wash, bathe, and groom dogs outside in the summer months without the need for special equipment. If your son has experience with reptiles, birds, rabbits, or other household pets, those opportunities might be better. When families go on summer vacation, they often need someone to look after their pets and homes.\n\n\u2022 Home upkeep: Cleaning houses is a year-round opportunity to generate income. The summer months, in particular, are good for repainting items, power washing, and upkeep on exteriors. Fences may need patching and new rocks spread in driveways.\n\n\u2022 Tutoring: Many parents worry that their children will forget what they've learned during the school year. In the absence of a formal summer school, weekly tutoring can help get children back on track and ready for the next grade level. If your son excels in academics, he can ask for recommendations from his teachers to help others before the school year ends.\n\n\u2022 Selling items: If your child has accumulated clothes and toys that they've outgrown or no longer need, a yard sale may be a way to generate income. If someone else in your neighborhood is having a yard sale, they could also contribute baked goods or lemonade for sale to generate a profit. This could be a beneficial lesson in economics too.\n\nI hope one of these works for your son!","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

Surprisingly enough, goldfish have brains. If you thought they were aimlessly moving around, goldfish are smarter than you think. They spend most of their time finding the best spot to relax, interact and engage with the other tank mates.\n\n2. Goldfish eyes can detect ultraviolet and infrared rays. In addition, instead of seeing a combination of three different colors like humans, goldfish eyes can see a blend of four different colors. The primary reason behind this additional feature is to help them hunt for food in their surroundings. However, their eyes are on either side of their face, creating a blind spot in the middle of their face.\n\n3. When it comes to their vision, they cannot see very far ahead in the water. Also, they don\u2019t have eyelids, which prevents them from closing their eyes. So, even when they are sleeping, their eyes remain open. So, if you have a pet goldfish, we\u2019d recommend switching off the light in the water body to ensure they get good sleep.\n\n4. Due to consistent cross-breeding, goldfish have mutated and evolved in terms of their genetic structure, color, and appearance. As a result, over 200 different types of goldfish species are available.\n\n5. Like humans, goldfish taste their food before they gobble things down. So, when you offer them food inside the aquarium, you will often find them nibbling on the food before they wipe it out. And a unique fact about goldfish is that they taste with their lips and not their tongue. The majority of their taste buds are on their lips. Goldfish don\u2019t have a tongue.\n\n6. Although goldfish look very delicate, they are adamant and hardy. Even with a change in the water parameters, they can easily sustain the rough conditions. They can quickly acclimatize themselves to the change in water pH, temperature, and living conditions.\n\n7. They have their teeth in the back of their throat. Also known as pharyngeal teeth, goldfish are the only species on Earth with their teeth at the back of their throat. Like the standard functionality of the teeth, they help in grinding down the food for easier digestion.\n\n8. Surprisingly, there is no \u201caverage\u201d size to a goldfish because they can dramatically vary in size. Most of the time, a goldfish grows depending on the tank size. If kept in a smaller tank, they will have lesser growth, but when kept in larger aquariums. In the wild, a goldfish can grow up to the size of an adult carp.\n\n9. Goldfish don\u2019t have a stomach. Instead, they typically digest their food through different parts of the intestine. So, the duration of the digestion is relatively more minor, leaving them hungry quite frequently than most of the other fish species.\n\n10. As adorable and innocent as they look, goldfish are invaders. This means they will quickly take over the native species when you leave them in the wild. So even in captivity, it is essential to choose suitable tank mates for them. They are very prolific cross-breeders too, which results in drastic genetic mutations where they live.","prompt_id":"45ea0ff345dc8dc11da863fbb578654f56435ca6b1e0e3ea566809380edecfd7","messages":[{"content":"Turn each numbered group of sentences into a question and answer.

Sign or not, the spot is going completely unused. Therefore, I want to ask you if you think I could use it. I have watched the spot every day and have yet to see a car in it. The way I see it, we better use it than lose it to another suite in the building. I'd be doing the company a favor, really. \n\nIf you do manage to check your email sometime this week, then know that I have already assumed you said yes. The truth is, I've been parking there all week. This is just a formality, really. Best of luck with your \"clients.\" Oh, and don't forget to follow through.\n\nRegards,\n\nHaley","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Items you'll want to use for decorating include a cake scraper, an icing spatula, a cake disk, and a piping bag. \n\n2. Freeze your cake for 15 minutes after assembling and applying the first thin layer of frosting, the crumb coat. The crumb coat holds your cake together, so if you see cake layers mixing into the buttercream, you need to freeze your cake for a few more minutes to allow the crumb coat to set.\n\n3. Use your cake scrapper at a 45-degree angle to create lovely smooth edges for your cake. Using your scrapper at this angle will let you be almost eye level with your cake to see what is happening as you smooth it out closely.\n\n4. Make clean-cut edges on your cake using an acrylic cake disk when applying your buttercream. An acrylic cake disk will help you make the flat cake top and straight edges you want on your cake.\n\n5. When piping your cake, keep it from the edge of the cake. Instead, you'll want to decorate the cake by holding the piping bag slightly toward the middle to ensure that the frosting doesn't fall off the edge of the cake.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"}

Desperation loomed in her eyes as she realized the harsh reality of their predicament. She sent her children out into a dangerous world to seek their fortunes because she was determined to give them a chance at survival. \n\nThe first little pig possessed a lazy soul. Hard work was a foreign concept to him and he chose to build his house out of fragile straw. Despite being a little more diligent, the second little pig lacked genuine ambition. He fashioned his dwelling from feeble sticks. Together, they passed away their time, singing, dancing, and foolishly believing in their invincibility.\n\nIn the shadows of their flimsy homes, a wolve crept, driven by hunger and a predatory instinct. Its predatory eyes spotted the straw house, and its mouth began to salivate as the alluring smell of the pig drifted through the air. The wolf growled and banged and banged on the door with a menacing tone.\n\n\"Little pig! Little pig!\nLet me in! Let me in!\"\n\nFear tightened the first little pig's heart as he glimpsed the wolf's menacing paws through the keyhole. Trembling, he replied:\n\n\"No! No! No!\nNot by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!\"\n\nEnraged, the wolf bared its fangs and snarled:\n\n\"Then I'll huff\nand I'll puff\nand I'll blow your house down.\"\n\nWith a mighty gust, it huffed and it puffed, until the flimsy straw house crumbled before its power. The wolf lunged, its jaws snapping shut with a vicious hunger. But the first little pig narrowly escaped, fleeing to seek refuge with his slightly more resourceful brother. Unfazed, the wolf continued to pursue its prey down the narrow lane. It noticed the second house, which was made of flimsy sticks. The pigs inside felt the threat after spotting the wolf's protruding ears through the keyhole. Fear flooded their bodies as they adamantly proclaimed\n\n\"No! No! No!\nNot by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\"\n\nThe wolf's hunger swelled, consuming its senses, and clouding its judgment. It snarled, revealing sharp teeth:\n\n\"Then I'll huff\nand I'll puff\nand I'll blow your house down!\"\n\nThe wolf unleashed its fury, unleashing a tempest that tore the flimsy building to pieces. However, its greed outweighed its cunning, and the two little pigs managed to escape while frantically stamping their hooves against the ground. The chase continued an ominous pursuit in the dim light of the fading day. The three little pigs, their hearts pounding with terror, found solace within the walls of the brick house. They huddled together, aware that the wolf's insatiable appetite yearned for their flesh. And the truth was very, very real. The wolf approached the door, its breath rife with sinister intent.\n\n\"Little pigs! Little pigs!\nLet me in! Let me in!\"\n\nThe pigs, their eyes filled with dread, caught sight of the wolf's narrowed gaze through the keyhole. They mustered the strength to reply:\n\n\"No! No! No!\nNot by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\"\n\nEnraged, the wolf's primal rage took hold. Its teeth were bared, its voice filled with malice:\n\n\"Then I'll huff\nand I'll puff\nand I'll blow your house down.\"\n\nThe wolf attacked because it was desperate. It pursued with a relentless huff and puff. But the sturdy brick house remained unmoving. impervious to the onslaught. Exhausted and breathless, the wolf succumbed to defeat, forced to pause and gather its waning strength.\n\nIn a twisted revelation, the wolf devised a diabolical plan. Frenzied with fury, it vowed to descend through the chimney and consume the little pig as its final prize. Unbeknownst to the wolf, the clever pig had stoked a blazing fire and set a cauldron of boiling water to simmer. As the wolf descended into the depths of the chimney, the pig removed the lid, and with a sudden thud, the predator plunged into the scalding inferno.\n\nThe little pig swiftly sealed the cauldron, boiling the wolf alive, its screams drowned in the bubbling fury of its demise. The three little pigs, tainted by darkness and survival, dined on their once-predator, savoring the taste of victory amidst the haunting echoes of their harrowing ordeal.\n\n\n","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Rewrite"}

Here are some activities that can help to keep your kids entertained while camping:\n\n-Reading: Encourage the kids to bring 2 or 3 books each. They may be surprised at how quickly they\u2019ll get through them without any tech-based distractions.\n-Writing: Nature is full of inspiration. Have your kids bring some journals and writing utensils so they can jot down diary entries, poems, short stories, or anything else they want to write. \n-Games: Even if you\u2019re planning lots of wilderness adventures, it\u2019s a good idea to bring games in case of inclement weather. Bring some fun multiplayer board games, and a deck of cards in case anyone wants to play solitaire.\n-Arts and crafts: This will be a great time to experiment with arts and crafts such as watercolor painting, wood carving, knitting, embroidery, sculpting, wood burning\/etching, and more. Your kids could also try their hands at some extra messy projects like tie-dye, making goo from scratch, paper mache, or splatter painting a la Jackson Pollock since you won't have to worry about making a mess inside your home. \n-Puzzles: Bring a book of crosswords or sudoku puzzles, and maybe a jigsaw puzzle that the whole family can work on together.\n-Play music: Camping provides a great opportunity to practice playing acoustic instruments such as the guitar, ukulele, hand drums, flute, or fiddle.\n-Sports: Bring a soccer ball, basketball, football, or tennis ball and racket so the kids can play together and exhaust themselves with some exercise.\n-Hiking: Trail hiking makes a fun family excursion.\n-Boating: There are several bodies of water in the Sierra Mountains. If you own a boat, you can bring it with you, or you may be able to rent one just for the trip. You could canoe, kayak, or use a motorized boat. Have the kids bring bathing suits, too, in case the water's warm enough for a swim. \n-Biking: Like hiking, this is a great way to explore the area, but you\u2019ll be able to cover a lot more ground in a shorter amount of time on wheels than you could on foot.\n-Star gazing: Bring a book of star maps and\/or a telescope and spend the evenings searching for constellations and shooting stars.\n-Campfire rituals: Replace the habit of zoning out in front of the tv after dinner with a nightly campfire ritual. You can cook dinner over the fire, make s\u2019mores together, and take turns telling ghost stories, or opt for family stories if your kids don\u2019t enjoy being scared.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Brainstorm"}

{"prompt":"Summarize the main steps of how to grow roses in pots that this article suggests, shortened into 5 steps total, in a list format with a 1-2 sentence explanation each.  \n\nThe source text is as follows:\n\nChoose and Prepare Containers\nChoose a relatively large, tall pot when growing a rose bush. Many experts recommend a pot no less than 15 inches in diameter. Roses send down deep roots, so the taller the container, the better. The soil in pots heats up faster than garden soil, so clay pots are generally better than plastic since clay is slower to transfer heat from the sun into the soil. If you must use plastic pots, use lighter colored plastic, which won't heat up as fast as dark plastic.\n\nMake sure the pots have ample drainage holes in the bottom.\n\nPrepare the Potting Soil\nCreate a potting soil mixture consisting of one-third quality commercial potting soil, one-third garden compost, and one-third composted manure. Add a cup of perlite to enhance drainage. Add 1 cup of bonemeal to the soil mixture. If you wish, you can also add fishmeal or blood meal for added nutrients, but be careful not to over-fertilize, which can burn roots.\n\nPlant the Rose\nFill the pot about two-thirds full of prepared soil mix. If planting a bare root rose, mound the soil up in the center, then place the rose over the mound and spread the roots out over it. If planting a potted rose, just create a slight indentation, then remove the rose from its nursery container and place it into the pot. Loosen the roots if the plant is root bound. Fill in around the rose using the remaining potting soil, pressing it down firmly around the roots. The soil surface should be just slightly beneath the bud union\u2014the point where the rose is grafted to the rootstock.\n\nPlace your potted roses in a location that gets at least seven hours of direct sun each day. On patios and decks, this may mean moving the pots around over the course of the day to keep them in the sun. If you are growing groups of potted roses, keep them spaced at least 2 feet apart to ensure good air circulation.\n\nWater Thoughtfully\nImmediately after planting, water the plant thoroughly so that all the soil is well saturated. After planting, keep an eye on your roses so you know when to water. A good general rule of thumb is to water when the top inch of the soil surface feels dry.\n\nFertilize as Needed\nRepot Every Few Years\nExcept for miniature roses, most roses grown in pots need to be repotted every two or three years, since they are heavy feeders that quickly exhaust potting soils. Using freshly prepared potting soil each time you repot will keep the nutrient levels at an acceptable level. Over time, salts and minerals from fertilizers can also accumulate in the soil.\n\nProtect From Freezing Temperatures\nMulch the base\nBury it\nBuild a cold frame\nBring it inside\n\nAddress Pests and Diseases\nPotted roses are susceptible to many of the same pests and diseases that can plague roses planted in the garden.","prompt_id":"8c6c6f1fb9d165350b159ab8bf770c6ecacb6aa7bd1c61413cde33ccd8ef11d1","messages":[{"content":"Summarize the main steps of how to grow roses in pots that this article suggests, shortened into 5 steps total, in a list format with a 1-2 sentence explanation each.  \n\nThe source text is as follows:\n\nChoose and Prepare Containers\nChoose a relatively large, tall pot when growing a rose bush.

{"prompt":"Parse this text for all words and phrases related to space travel and arrange them in a comma-separated list in the order they appear in the article.\n\nOn April 20, 2023, a new SpaceX rocket called Starship exploded over the Gulf of Mexico three minutes into its first flight ever. SpaceX is calling the test launch a success, despite the fiery end result. As a space policy expert, I agree that the \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly\u201d \u2013 the term SpaceX uses when its rockets explode \u2013 was a very successful failure.\n\nA large rocket standing next to a tower.\nThe full Starship stack comprises a Starship spacecraft (in black) on top of a rocket dubbed Super Heavy (in silver) and is nearly 400 feet (120 meters) tall. Hotel Marmot\/Flickr, CC BY-SA\nThe most powerful rocket ever built\nThis launch was the first fully integrated test of SpaceX\u2019s new Starship. Starship is the most powerful rocket ever developed and is designed to be fully reusable. It is made of two different stages, or sections. The first stage, called Super Heavy, is a collection of 33 individual engines and provides more than twice the thrust of a Saturn V, the rocket that sent astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe first stage is designed to get the rocket to about 40 miles (65 kilometers) above Earth. Once Super Heavy\u2019s job is done, it is supposed to separate from the rest of the craft and land safely back on the surface to be used again. At that point the second stage, called the Starship spacecraft, is supposed to ignite its own engines to carry the payload \u2013 whether people, satellites or anything else \u2013 into orbit.\n\nAn explosive first flight\nWhile parts of Starship have been tested previously, the launch on April 20, 2023, was the first fully integrated test with the Starship spacecraft stacked on top of the Super Heavy rocket. If it had been successful, once the first stage was spent, it would have separated from the upper stage and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Starship would then have continued on, eventually crashing 155 miles (250 kilometers) off of Hawaii.\n\nRead news coverage based on evidence, not tweets\nDuring the SpaceX livestream, the team stated that the primary goal of this mission was to get the rocket off the launch pad. It accomplished that goal and more. Starship flew for more than three minutes, passing through what engineers call \u201cmax Q\u201d \u2013 the moment at which a rocket experiences the most physical stress from acceleration and air resistance.\n\nA cloud of fire and smoke in the sky with pieces falling Earthward.\nThe Starship spacecraft and Super Hheavy rocket were unable to separate during the flight, so engineers blew up the full rocket. AP Photo\/Eric Gay\nAccording to SpaceX, a few things went wrong with the launch.

Hotel Marmot\/Flickr, CC BY-SA\nThe most powerful rocket ever built\nThis launch was the first fully integrated test of SpaceX\u2019s new Starship. Starship is the most powerful rocket ever developed and is designed to be fully reusable. It is made of two different stages, or sections. The first stage, called Super Heavy, is a collection of 33 individual engines and provides more than twice the thrust of a Saturn V, the rocket that sent astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe first stage is designed to get the rocket to about 40 miles (65 kilometers) above Earth. Once Super Heavy\u2019s job is done, it is supposed to separate from the rest of the craft and land safely back on the surface to be used again. At that point the second stage, called the Starship spacecraft, is supposed to ignite its own engines to carry the payload \u2013 whether people, satellites or anything else \u2013 into orbit.\n\nAn explosive first flight\nWhile parts of Starship have been tested previously, the launch on April 20, 2023, was the first fully integrated test with the Starship spacecraft stacked on top of the Super Heavy rocket. If it had been successful, once the first stage was spent, it would have separated from the upper stage and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Starship would then have continued on, eventually crashing 155 miles (250 kilometers) off of Hawaii.\n\nRead news coverage based on evidence, not tweets\nDuring the SpaceX livestream, the team stated that the primary goal of this mission was to get the rocket off the launch pad. It accomplished that goal and more. Starship flew for more than three minutes, passing through what engineers call \u201cmax Q\u201d \u2013 the moment at which a rocket experiences the most physical stress from acceleration and air resistance.\n\nA cloud of fire and smoke in the sky with pieces falling Earthward.\nThe Starship spacecraft and Super Hheavy rocket were unable to separate during the flight, so engineers blew up the full rocket.
