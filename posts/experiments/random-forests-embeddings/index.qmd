Natural language processing (NLP) is often associated with deep learning and neural networks. However, there are efficient methods for text classification that do not rely on neural networks. In this exploration, we will demonstrate a sentiment analysis classification problem using text embeddings combined with traditional machine learning algorithms.

The task at hand is sentiment analysis: classifying tweets as positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant. Sentiment analysis determines the emotional tone of text. Although neural networks, particularly models like BERT, are popular for this task, traditional machine learning algorithms can also be effective when used with modern text embeddings.

We will use a Twitter dataset containing labeled tweets to classify their sentiment. Our approach involves using the BERT tokenizer and embeddings (we previously [looked at the basics of embeddings](/posts/experiments/gensim)) for text preprocessing, followed by traditional machine learning algorithms for classification.

Using traditional machine learning algorithms offers several advantages. They are generally faster and require less computational power compared to deep learning models, making them suitable for resource-limited scenarios. Additionally, traditional algorithms are often easier to interpret, providing more transparency in decision-making processes. Moreover, traditional algorithms can achieve competitive performance when combined with powerful text embeddings like those from BERT.


## Loading and understanding the data

Let’s start by loading the dataset and understanding its structure. The dataset contains tweets labeled as positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant. We will load the data and examine a few samples to understand the text and labels.

```{python}
# Download the dataset

!kaggle datasets download -d jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis -p .data/ --unzip
```

```{python}
# Load dataset
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

sentiment = pd.read_csv('.data/twitter_training.csv')
sentiment_validation = pd.read_csv('.data/twitter_validation.csv')

# Add column names
sentiment.columns = ['id', 'tag', 'sentiment', 'text']
sentiment_validation.columns = ['id', 'tag', 'sentiment', 'text']

sentiment
```

Let's count the number of samples for each sentiment category in the dataset, so we can understand the distribution of labels.

```{python}
sentiment['sentiment'].value_counts()
```

Note how the `Irrelevant` category has the least number of samples, which might pose a challenge for training a classifier. Let us also check the category distribution for the validation set.

```{python}
sentiment_validation['sentiment'].value_counts()
```

Before continuing, we will also drop any rows with missing values in the text column.

```{python}
# Validate that 'text' is not null or empty
sentiment = sentiment.dropna(subset=['text'])
sentiment_validation = sentiment_validation.dropna(subset=['text'])
```

## Calculating embeddings using BERT

We will be using the [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bert) model for generating embeddings for the text data. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful pre-trained language model that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks. In this case, we will use BERT to generate embeddings for the tweets in our dataset.

We have explored BERT embeddings in a [previous experiment](/posts/experiments/bert-emotions). As reference, in that experiment, a fine tuned BERT model achieved an accuracy of 0.87.

```{python}
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import pytorch_lightning as pl
import pandas as pd

# Define a LightningModule that wraps the BERT model and tokenizer
class BERTEmbeddingModule(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
        self.bert_model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
    
    def forward(self, texts):
        # Tokenize the input texts
        inputs = self.tokenizer(
            texts, 
            return_tensors='pt', 
            truncation=True, 
            padding=True, 
            max_length=512
        )
        # Ensure inputs are on the same device as the model
        device = next(self.parameters()).device
        inputs = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in inputs.items()}
        outputs = self.bert_model(**inputs)
        # Average the last hidden state over the sequence length dimension
        embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)
        return embeddings

# Determine the device: CUDA, MPS, or CPU
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device('cuda')
elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = torch.device('mps')
else:
    device = torch.device('cpu')
print(f'Using device: {device}')

# Initialize the model, move it to the correct device, and set it to evaluation mode
bert_model = BERTEmbeddingModule()
bert_model.to(device)
bert_model.eval()

# Convert text columns to lists
sentiment_texts = sentiment['text'].tolist()
sentiment_validation_texts = sentiment_validation['text'].tolist()

batch_size = 64

# Compute embeddings in batches for the sentiment DataFrame
sentiment_embeddings = []
with torch.no_grad():
    for i in range(0, len(sentiment_texts), batch_size):
        batch_texts = sentiment_texts[i:i+batch_size]
        batch_embeddings = bert_model(batch_texts)
        sentiment_embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings.cpu().numpy())
        if (i // batch_size) % 20 == 0:
            print(f'Processed {i} sentences', end='\r')

# Add the embeddings to the sentiment DataFrame
sentiment = sentiment.assign(embedding=sentiment_embeddings)

# Compute embeddings in batches for the sentiment_validation DataFrame
sentiment_validation_embeddings = []
with torch.no_grad():
    for i in range(0, len(sentiment_validation_texts), batch_size):
        batch_texts = sentiment_validation_texts[i:i+batch_size]
        batch_embeddings = bert_model(batch_texts)
        sentiment_validation_embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings.cpu().numpy())
        if (i // batch_size) % 20 == 0:
            print(f'Processed {i} validation sentences', end='\r')

# Add the embeddings to the sentiment_validation DataFrame
sentiment_validation = sentiment_validation.assign(embedding=sentiment_validation_embeddings)
```

Let's check what the embeddings look like for a sample tweet.

```{python}
# Show a few random samples of the sentiment DataFrame
sentiment.sample(3, random_state=42)
```

Notice the computed embedding vector for the tweet. This vector captures the semantic information of the text, which can be used as input for traditional machine learning algorithms. Let us look at the embedding in more detail.

```{python}
# Show the first 20 embedding values for row 0 of the sentiment DataFrame, and its shape
print(sentiment.loc[0, 'embedding'][:20])
print(sentiment.loc[0, 'embedding'].shape)
```

The embedding vector has 768 dimensions, encoding the semantic information of the text data. Different models may have different embedding dimensions, but BERT embeddings are typically 768 or 1024 dimensions.

Let us also drop the `tag` and `id` columns from the training and validation sets, as they are not needed for classification.

```{python}
# Drop the 'tag' and 'id' columns
sentiment = sentiment.drop(columns=['tag', 'id'])
sentiment_validation = sentiment_validation.drop(columns=['tag', 'id'])
```

And finally before we continue, let us evaluate the degree of separation between the classes in the embedding space. We will use [t-SNE](/posts/experiments/pca-vs-tsne) to visualize the embeddings in 2D space.

```{python}
# Plot a t-SNE visualization of the embeddings
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Copy the sentiment DataFrame to avoid modifying the original
sentiment_tsne = sentiment.copy()

# Convert sentiment labels to numerical values
sentiment_tsne['sentiment_num'] = sentiment['sentiment'].astype('category').cat.codes

# Compute a t-SNE embedding of the embeddings
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2)
tsne_results = tsne.fit_transform(np.stack(sentiment_tsne['embedding']))

# Plot the t-SNE visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

# Map the numerical values back to the original sentiment labels
unique_sentiments = sentiment_tsne['sentiment'].unique()
colors = plt.cm.summer_r(np.linspace(0, 1, len(unique_sentiments)))

# Create a scatter plot with a legend
for i, sentiment_label in enumerate(unique_sentiments):
    indices = sentiment_tsne['sentiment'] == sentiment_label
    plt.scatter(tsne_results[indices, 0], tsne_results[indices, 1], label=sentiment_label, c=[colors[i]], alpha=0.5)

plt.xlabel('t-SNE Component 1')
plt.ylabel('t-SNE Component 2')
plt.title('t-SNE visualization of text embeddings')
plt.legend(title='Sentiment')
plt.show()
```

It's hard to discern much separation between the classes in the 2D t-SNE plot. This suggests that the classes are not easily separable in the embedding space, which might pose a challenge for classification.

## Evaluating traditional machine learning algorithms

In this experiment, we will evaluate the performance of both Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers on the dataset. We will train these classifiers on the BERT embeddings and evaluate their performance on the validation set.

Both [Random Forest](/posts/experiments/random-forests) and XGBoost are powerful ensemble learning algorithms that can handle high-dimensional data but may be prone to overfitting. We will tune their hyperparameters using grid search to optimize performance.

## About Cross validation

Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to assess how a model will generalize to an independent dataset. It involves partitioning the original dataset into a set of training and validation subsets. The most common form of cross-validation is k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is randomly divided into $\mathbf{k}$ equally sized folds.

The model is trained on $\mathbf{k-1}$ folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated $\mathbf{k}$ times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. The performance metric (such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error) is averaged over the k iterations to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

This method helps in detecting overfitting and ensures that the model's evaluation is not overly dependent on a particular subset of the data. By using cross-validation, one can make better decisions about model selection and hyperparameter tuning, leading to more reliable and generalizable models.

        return self.label_encoder.inverse_transform(y_pred)

    def predict_proba(self, X):
        return self.model.predict_proba(X)

    def get_params(self, deep=True):
        return self.params

    def set_params(self, **params):
        self.params.update(params)
        self.model.set_params(**self.params)
        return self

# Extract features (embeddings) and labels
X = np.vstack(sentiment['embedding'].values)
y = sentiment['sentiment'].values

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the classifiers and their respective parameter grids
classifiers = {
    'RandomForest': RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, n_jobs=-1),
    'XGBoost': XGBClassifierWrapper()
}

param_grids = {
    'RandomForest': {
        'n_estimators': [200, 300],
        'max_depth': [10, 20],

    }
}

# Define a custom scoring function that balances precision, recall, and accuracy
scoring = {
    'accuracy': 'accuracy',

}

# Perform grid search for each classifier, and store the best models

for name, clf in classifiers.items():
    # Perform grid search with cross-validation, using f1 score as the metric (balancing precision and recall)
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grids[name], cv=3, scoring=scoring, n_jobs=-1, verbose=1, refit='f1')
    grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
    best_models[name] = grid_search.best_estimator_
    print(f'{name} best parameters:', grid_search.best_params_)
```

We trained both Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers on the training set. We used the F1 score as the evaluation metric, as it provides a balance between precision and recall. The F1 score is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets, like the one we have, where the number of samples in each class is not equal. In particular, we used L1 and L2 regularization for XGBoost to prevent overfitting.

Now, we will evaluate the performance of the Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers on the validation set to choose the best performing model.

```{python}
# Validation set
X_val = np.vstack(sentiment_validation['embedding'].values)
y_val = sentiment_validation['sentiment'].values
print(X_val.shape)
print(y_val.shape)

# Evaluate the best models on the validation set and choose the best one
best_model = None
best_accuracy = 0

for name, model in best_models.items():
    y_val_pred = model.predict(X_val)
    accuracy_val = accuracy_score(y_val, y_val_pred)
    report_val = classification_report(y_val, y_val_pred)
    
    print(f'Validation Accuracy for {name}: {accuracy_val}')
    print(f'Classification Report for {name}:\n{report_val}\n')
    
    if accuracy_val > best_accuracy:
        best_accuracy = accuracy_val
        best_model = model
        best_y_val_pred = y_val_pred

print(f'Best Model: {best_model}')
print(f'Best Validation Accuracy: {best_accuracy}')
```

The XGBoost classifier outperforms the Random Forest classifier on the validation set, achieving an F1 score of 0.81, significantly higher than the Random Forest's F1 score of 0.74.

::: {.callout-note}
## About the F1 score

The F1 score is a metric that combines precision and recall into a single value. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall:

$$
F1 = 2 \times \frac{precision \times recall}{precision + recall}
$$

The F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible score. It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it provides a balance between precision and recall. A high F1 score indicates that the classifier has both high precision and high recall, making it a good choice for evaluating models on imbalanced datasets.
:::

The `Irrelevant` class has the lowest F1-score, which is expected given the class imbalance in the dataset. Removing the `Irrelevant` class from the dataset, or merging it with `Neutral` would improve the overall performance of the classifier by quite a few points.

The confusion matrix for the XGBoost classifier on the validation set looks as follows:

```{python}
# Plot a confusion matrix with a summer_r colormap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

cm = confusion_matrix(y_val, best_y_val_pred)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='summer_r', xticklabels=best_model.classes_, yticklabels=best_model.classes_)
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

As expected, the `Irrelevant` class has the lowest precision and recall, while the `Positive` class has the highest precision and recall. The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the classifier's performance on each class.

Let us also calculate the per-class accuracy for the XGBoost classifier on the validation set.

```{python}
# Plot accuracy for each class
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Calculate accuracy for each class
class_accuracies = {}
for i, class_name in enumerate(best_model.classes_):
    class_accuracies[class_name] = accuracy_score(y_val[y_val == class_name], best_y_val_pred[y_val == class_name])

# Sort classes by accuracy
class_accuracies = dict(sorted(class_accuracies.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True))

# Plot accuracy for each class using summer_r colormap
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
colors = plt.cm.summer_r(np.linspace(0, 1, len(class_accuracies)))
bars = plt.barh(list(class_accuracies.keys()), list(class_accuracies.values()), color=colors)

# Add accuracy values to each color bar
for bar in bars:
    width = bar.get_width()
    plt.text(width + 0.01, bar.get_y() + bar.get_height() / 2, f'{width:.2f}', va='center')

plt.xlabel('Accuracy')
plt.ylabel('Class')
plt.title('Accuracy by Class')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()  # Invert y-axis to have the highest accuracy at the top
plt.show()
```

And finally let us evaluate the performance of the XGBoost classifier on a set of entirely new, general sentences. These are sentences that the model has not seen before or which originate from the original dataset, and will help us understand how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

```{python}
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Test sentences with their corresponding true sentiments (Positive/Negative/Neutral/Irrelevant)
test_sentences = [
    ("This ice cream is delicious!", "Positive"),
    ("I hate this phone.", "Negative"),
    ("I love this car.", "Positive"),
    ("I don't like this book.", "Negative"),

    ("I'm so excited about this!", "Positive"),
    ("This is very upsetting.", "Negative"),
    ("The sky is blue.", "Neutral"),
    ("Water is wet.", "Neutral"),
    ("I have a meeting tomorrow.", "Irrelevant"),
    ("The cat is on the roof.", "Neutral"),

## Final remarks

In this exploration, we demonstrated the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms when combined with modern text embeddings for sentiment analysis. While deep learning models like BERT have set a high standard in NLP tasks, traditional algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost can still achieve competitive performance with significantly lower computational requirements.

Traditional machine learning algorithms are generally faster and require less computational power compared to deep learning models, making them suitable for scenarios where computational resources are limited. Additionally, traditional algorithms offer more transparency, allowing us to better understand how decisions are made. This is particularly valuable in applications where model interpretability is crucial.

When paired with powerful text embeddings like those generated by BERT, traditional machine learning algorithms can deliver strong performance. Our experiments showed that XGBoost, in particular, outperformed Random Forest in terms of accuracy and F1 score on the validation set. The challenge of class imbalance was evident in the lower performance of the `Irrelevant` class, and techniques such as re-sampling, cost-sensitive learning, or refining the model's hyperparameters could further improve performance in future studies.

The methodology presented is practical and can be easily adapted to various text classification problems beyond sentiment analysis. This flexibility underscores the value of combining traditional machine learning algorithms with modern text embeddings.
