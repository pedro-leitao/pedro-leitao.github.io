Hello! I am Pedro Leit√£o (vaguely pronounced as "Pe-drow Lay-tow"). Professionally, I am
a chief architect in the software industry, mostly engaging in Cloud Native systems design, Systems Thinking, Analytics & Data Science, Machine Learning and AI. More importantly, I am a father and adventurer in all things family-related.

I love embracing new challenges, continuous learning, and mentoring others - I build and manage high-performance tech teams while keeping a hands-on approach. Based in London, but you will often find me somewhere further south.

In this site you will find a collection [of thoughts](thoughts.qmd), [how to's](howtos.qmd) and [experiments](experiments.qmd) that I have fiddled with over time. Find out more about [why I write](/about.qmd).
