  <title>Adam’s Apple</title>
  <link>https://pedroleitao.nl/posts/experiments/adam-optimisation/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ A key component of training deep learning models is the choice of optimisation algorithm. There are several approaches, ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">:link simple stochastic gradient descent</a> (SGD) to more advanced methods like Adam. In this experiment, we’ll try to give an intuitive understanding of what optimisation means in the context of machine learning, briefly discussing the Adam algorithm. ]]></description>

  <title>Maps and More Maps</title>
  <link>https://pedroleitao.nl/posts/experiments/maps-and-maps/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ Recently I was trying to figure out sun exposure for a specific location, except I was a couple of thousand kilometers away, and needed to get a sense of the sun’s path relative to a rooftop. There are quite a few tools available online (like <a href="https://suncalc.org">SunCalc</a>), and some mobile apps which pretty much can do the job. But, I really wanted to find out if I could do it myself from first principles. ]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[ I’ve been using <a href="https://jupyterbook.org">JupyterBook</a> to create this site for a while, and I’ve been pretty happy with it. But I’ve recently started using <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a>, and I think it’s better. Here’s why. ]]></description>

  <title>France, AI and Back to Nuclear for Germany ?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ President Macron has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/france-invest-109-billion-euros-ai-macron-announces-2025-02-09/">just signalled that France is about to announce €109 billion private sector investments in AI</a>. This is a significant amount of money, even for a country like France. It is also a clear statement that at least some European countries might be serious about investing in digital. ]]></description>

  <title>How GPU’s work, an explainer using the Mandelbrot set</title>
  <link>https://pedroleitao.nl/posts/experiments/parallel-mandelbrot/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ Every day pretty much all of us either uses or hears about the mythical GPU, the Graphics Processing Unit. It’s the thing that makes your games, video renders, and your machine learning models train faster. But how does it achieve that? What makes it different from a CPU? ]]></description>

  <title>Reinforcement Learning - a Primer using Connect Four</title>
  <link>https://pedroleitao.nl/posts/experiments/connect-four-rl/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ One of the mainstay algorithms in machine learning is reinforcement learning (or <em>RL</em> for short). RL is an approach to machine learning that is used to teach an agent how to make decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. It learns by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. It then uses this feedback to learn the best strategy for achieving its goal. ]]></description>
