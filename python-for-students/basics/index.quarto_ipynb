        "There are many tools and skills which can help you to become a better critical thinker, but one of the most important ones is learning how to program. Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to execute, and because computers are fundamentally logic machines, programming is a great way to develop your logical thinking skills. Learning a programming language like Python can help you to think more clearly, solve problems more effectively, and communicate more precisely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a high-level, dynamically typed multiparadigm programming language. Python code is often said to be almost like pseudocode, since it allows you to express very powerful ideas in very few lines of code while being very readable.\n",

        "## Why Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a great language for beginners because it is easy to learn and use. Python has a simple and clean syntax that makes it easy to read and write, and it has a large standard library that provides a wide range of modules and packages to help you write your programs. Python is also a very versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis to artificial intelligence. Equally important, Python is fairly forgiving, which means that it is easy to write code that works, even if it is not perfect.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other great thing is that Python for many years [has been the most popular programming language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) in the world, favoured by professional software developers, engineers, scientists and data analysts, which means there are a lot of resources available to help you learn and use Python. There are many books, tutorials, and online courses that can help you get started, and there are many libraries and frameworks that can help you build your own projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Being popular also means that Python is a sought-after skill in the job market, and that the time you spend learning it will be well spent. Think of it as an investment in your future rather than yet another thing to learn.\n",

        "Python programs execute code line by line, as a sequence of instructions for the computer to follow. Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is not compiled into machine code.

        "\n",
        "When you execute a computer program, they are often stored in a file, in Windows this file is called a `.exe` file, in Linux or Mac it is called an executable file. You can't read these files, they are in machine code. Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is not compiled into machine code, but is translated into bytecode at runtime, which is then executed by the Python interpreter. This is why if you open a `.py` file with a text editor, you can read the original code.\n",
        ":::\n",
        "\n",
        "Python programs are typically organized into files, which are stored in directories. A directory that contains Python files is called a package, and a directory that contains packages is called a library. Python comes with a large standard library that provides a wide range of modules and packages to help you write your programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python files typically have the `.py` extension, which indicates that they are Python files. Python files can be executed from the command line by running the `python` command followed by the name of the file. For example, to run a file called `hello.py`, you would run a command like:\n",
