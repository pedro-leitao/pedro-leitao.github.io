It is meant to be a gentle and *concise* introduction to programming and Python, with a focus on practical data and machine learning applications and examples. It is not meant to be comprehensive or authoritative, but rather a starting point for students who are new to programming. This is inspired by trying to teach the basics of data, data science, machine learning and programming to my own son, who is studying an engineering degree.\n\nContent in this book will grow over time, and will be updated and expanded as I have time. There are many excellent resources available for learning Python, and I will try to provide links to some of them as I go along. I will also try to provide references to more advanced topics and resources for students who want to go deeper.\n\nThis book does not try to be in any way a replacement for a formal course in Python programming, or a replacement for many of the excellent books and online resources available, some of which include:\n\n- [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Crash-Course-3Rd-Matthes/dp/1718502702/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=tG279&content-id=amzn1.sym.a4ac6c4d-6ae7-4d95-b5e0-812c9dcfc72e%3Aamzn1.symc.fc11ad14-99c1-406b-aa77-051d0ba1aade&pf_rd_p=a4ac6c4d-6ae7-4d95-b5e0-812c9dcfc72e&pf_rd_r=X3RVQFX8P18QB5Q7R8SV&pd_rd_wg=K6ISH&pd_rd_r=81da5d1c-e7f7-4a20-b92c-fffa29e39c81&ref_=pd_hp_d_atf_ci_mcx_mr_ca_hp_atf_d)\n- [Python Programming For Beginners Made Easy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Programming-Beginners-Made-Hands/dp/B0CY2VGHQ5/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1FPJAM0A5YUTM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IVkgF--i1xibH_M29RxHiHkoi5IBZHiw10EjBMVYtJ7-awZiveG7I-pGR4J0dKLWT9S03C2Uqq5i-zqU_8_VcrbnSaONAxo2JkzBvYahR1kIGEP87LjKf61cAR1AYsX5X05LnKmfZVTEmAULZLyi8zRFq02UXn8hVfu4E5hVSzcES5QsGpkFTGVeRXM5R_eBMtc9a_wOAzDoGoiarDhDTo9IN0EbPXqmL7w6hiSWSnY.WF6s3lQL-0maBHv5fJwCNw0uKwlDbHFKe4HCTxoMJbg&dib_tag=se&keywords=python+for+beginners&qid=1736814841&sprefix=python+for+be%2Caps%2C96&sr=8-5)\n- [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)\n\n## Why learning to program matters\n\nThere's a great Big Think [article](https://bigthink.com/articles/computational-thinking/) on why computational thinking and learning to program is important. It is a great read, and it makes a compelling case for why learning to program is important, even if you are not planning to become a software developer. This is particularly true for students in disciplines that are increasingly data-driven, such as the social sciences, engineering, business, and the natural sciences.\n\nComputational thinking is a way of solving problems which can be used by anyone, not just computer scientists. It involves breaking down a problem into smaller parts, and then solving each part in a logical way. This is a skill that can be used in many different areas, and it is becoming increasingly important in a world where data is everywhere.\n\n## A bit of personal advice\n\nLearning to think computationally, and learning to program, can be challenging and sometimes frustrating. If you are new to technology and programming, it can be overwhelming at first. However once you get the hang of it, and you see yourself improving, it can be tremendously rewarding. Potential future employers will also appreciate your ability to work with data and technology, even if you *think* knowing how to write code, and solving problems with a computer is not that relevant for your area of work.\n\nToday everything, and I mean *everything*, is data driven. Knowing how to *think* and work around data is a skill which will be a big contributor to your future success. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, and don't be afraid to ask for help, but whatever you do, stick with it!\n\nYou will be glad you did.\n\n",
