Stepping up from the tried-and-true Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), KANs are not just another update — they're very much a whole new different approach. They're designed to outpace their predecessors in accuracy and efficiency, and offer a clearer window into how they make decisions.\n\nLet's briefly explore the theoretical underpinnings of KANs, their practical applications, and the implications they hold for the future of AI, mostly without the use of any formulas.\n\n\n\n## Theoretical foundation and design of KANs\n\nInspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold [representation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov–Arnold_representation_theorem), KANs reconfigure the typical neural network architecture by replacing fixed activation functions on nodes with learnable activation functions on edges, eliminating linear weights entirely. This change, though seemingly simple, enables KANs to outperform MLPs substantially in various tasks, including data fitting, classification and partial differential equation (PDE) solving.\n\nThe theoretical implications of this are profound. Traditionally, MLPs have been constrained by their reliance on a large number of parameters and their opaque, black-box nature. KANs, by contrast, introduce a model where each \"weight\" is a univariate function parameterized as a spline, allowing for a more nuanced interaction with data. This structure not only reduces the number of necessary parameters but also enhances the interpretability of the model by making its operations more transparent and understandable to practitioners.\n\n## Practical applications and performance\n\nEmpirically, KANs have demonstrated superior performance over MLPs in several benchmarks. The original paper highlights their ability to achieve comparable or superior accuracy with significantly smaller models. For example, in tasks involving the solving of partial differencial equations, a smaller-sized KAN outperformed a larger MLP both in terms of accuracy and parameter efficiency—achieving a *hundredfold increase in accuracy with a thousandfold reduction in parameters*.\n\nMoreover, the adaptability of KANs to various data scales and their ability to learn and optimize univariate functions internally provide them with a distinct advantage, particularly in handling high-dimensional data spaces. This ability directly addresses and mitigates the curse of dimensionality, a longstanding challenge in machine learning.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## About the Curse of Dimensionality\n\nThe [\"curse of dimensionality\"](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/curse-of-dimensionality-machine-learning) describes several challenges that occur when handling high-dimensional spaces — spaces with a large number of variables — that do not arise in lower-dimensional environments. As dimensions increase, the volume of the space expands exponentially, leading to data becoming sparse. This sparsity complicates gathering sufficient data to ensure statistical methods are reliable and representative of the entire space.\n\nFor example, consider trying to uniformly fill a cube with data points. In a three-dimensional space, you might need 1000 samples for decent coverage (10 samples along each dimension). However, in ten dimensions, you'd need $10^{10}$ samples, which quickly becomes impractical.\n\n$$\nN(d) = 10^d\n$$\n\nWhere $\\mathbf{N(d)}$ represents the number of samples needed, and $\\mathbf{d}$ is the number of dimensions.\n\nAdditionally, in high-dimensional spaces, the concept of distance between data points becomes less meaningful as points tend to appear equidistant from one another. This undermines the effectiveness of distance-based methods such as clustering and nearest neighbors.\n\nWith more dimensions, the complexity of managing and analyzing data also increases, often requiring more computational power and sophisticated algorithms. Furthermore, there's a heightened risk of overfitting models in high dimensions. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, capturing random noise instead of the underlying data patterns, making it poor at predicting new or unseen data. These factors collectively underscore the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality in data analysis and machine learning.\n:::\n\n## Implications for AI and science\n\nThe implications of KANs extend beyond just enhanced performance metrics. By facilitating a more intuitive understanding of the underlying mathematical and physical principles, KANs can act as catalysts for scientific discovery. The whitepaper describes instances where KANs have helped rediscover mathematical and physical laws, underscoring their potential as tools for scientific inquiry and exploration.\n\nMoreover, the inherent interpretability of KANs makes them valuable for applications requiring transparency and explainability, such as in regulated industries like finance and healthcare. This characteristic could lead to broader acceptance and trust in AI solutions, paving the way for more widespread implementation of machine learning technologies in sensitive fields.\n\n## Future directions and challenges\n\nWhile KANs represent a significant leap forward, they are not without challenges. There are potential issues with the scalability of the spline-based approach, especially as the complexity of tasks increases. Future research will need to focus on optimizing these models for larger scale applications and exploring the integration of KANs with other types of neural networks to enhance their versatility.\n\nAdditionally, the full potential of KANs in terms of training dynamics, computational efficiency, and compatibility with existing machine learning frameworks remains to be fully explored. These areas offer rich avenues for further research and development.\n\n## A simple, brief example of a KAN\n\nTo illustrate the fundamental difference between KANs and MLPs, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have a dataset with two features, $\\mathbf{x_1}$ and $\\mathbf{x_2}$, and a binary target variable $\\mathbf{y}$. We want to build a simple classification model to predict $\\mathbf{y}$ based on the input features. Furthermore, let us pick a dataset that is not linearly separable and which would present a challenge for any ML model.\n\nLet's create a simple, synthetic dataset with `SKLearn` to demonstrate a KAN in action. In this case we will use the `make_circles` function to generate a toy dataset that is not linearly separable.\n\n::: {#c7b992b9 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport sklearn.datasets as datasets\nimport torch as torch\n\nCircles_points_train, Circles_label_train = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=1000,\n                                                                  shuffle=True,\n                                                                  factor=0.5,\n                                                                  noise=0.10,\n                                                                  random_state=42)\nCircles_points_test, Circles_label_test = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=1000,\n                                                                shuffle=True,\n                                                                factor=0.5,\n                                                                noise=0.10,\n                                                                random_state=43)\n\ndataset = {}\ndataset['train_input'] = torch.from_numpy(Circles_points_train).float() # Ensure that the data is float\ndataset['train_label'] = torch.from_numpy(Circles_label_train)\ndataset['test_input'] = torch.from_numpy(Circles_points_test).float()\ndataset['test_label'] = torch.from_numpy(Circles_label_test)\n\nX = dataset['train_input']\ny = dataset['train_label']\n\nprint(X.shape, y.shape)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ntorch.Size([1000, 2]) torch.Size([1000])\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset has 1000 samples, 2 features, and 2 classes.

This should be a good test for the KAN approach.\n\nLet's now create the model. It will have two input nodes, and two output nodes, one for each class. The key difference from an MLP is that the weights are replaced by learnable activation functions on the edges connecting the nodes.\n\n::: {#4ae8fe22 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport kan as kan\n\nmodel = kan.KAN(width=[2,2], grid=3, k=3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ncheckpoint directory created: ./model\nsaving model version 0.0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne great thing about the KAN `pytorch` implementation is that it alows us to easily visualize the model structure.

Their practical applications span a wide range of tasks, from data fitting to PDE solving, and their interpretability makes them valuable in scientific and regulated industries.\n\nWhile challenges remain in scaling KANs and integrating them with existing frameworks, their potential for future research and development is vast.\n\n",
