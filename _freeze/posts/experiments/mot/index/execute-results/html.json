Analysing and Predicting MOT Test Results\nsubtitle: dive deeper into data analysis using a real-world dataset\ndate: \"2024-02-20\"\ntags: \n  - Machine Learning\n  - Data Science\n  - Experiments\ncategories:\n  - Machine Learning\n  - Data Science\n  - Experiments\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n\nIn this experiment, we will be analysing the MOT test results of cars in the UK. The MOT test is an annual test of vehicle safety, roadworthiness aspects and exhaust emissions required in the United Kingdom for most vehicles over three years old. The MOT test is designed to ensure that a vehicle is roadworthy and safe to drive. The test checks the vehicle against a number of criteria, including the condition of the vehicle's brakes, lights, tyres, exhaust emissions, and more.\n\nThe dataset we will be using in this experiment is the [UK MOT test results dataset](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/e3939ef8-30c7-4ca8-9c7c-ad9475cc9b2f/anonymised-mot-tests-and-results) for 2023. Information includes the make, model, and year of the car, as well as the overal test result.\n\nLet us start by loading the dataset and taking a look at the first few rows.\n\n::: {#32989303 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Load .data/mot/test_results.csv as a dataframe\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nmot = pd.read_csv('.data/test_result.csv', sep='|')\n\n# drop the test_id and vehicle_id columns\nmot = mot.drop(['test_id'], axis=1)\nmot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr

down to just over 10 million rows, quite more manageable! This also means that our model will be able to focus on the most popular cars in the dataset, which _should_ help improve its accuracy.\n\n## Correlation matrix\n\nAs another step, let us calculate the correlation matrix for the dataset. This will help us understand the relationships between the different features, and will help us identify which features are most important in predicting the test result.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## About Correlation Matrixes\n\nIn statistics, correlation values are used to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. These values range from -1 to +1, with their sign indicating the direction of the relationship and their magnitude reflecting the strength.\n\n**Positive Correlation**: A positive correlation value indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases. Similarly, as one variable decreases, the other variable decreases. This kind of relationship implies that both variables move in tandem. A perfect positive correlation, with a coefficient of +1, means that for every incremental increase in one variable, there is a proportional increase in the other variable. An example might be the relationship between height and weight; generally, taller people tend to weigh more. In real-world data, perfect correlations are rare, but strong positive correlations often indicate a significant linear relationship.\n\n**Negative Correlation**: Conversely, a negative correlation value suggests that as one variable increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship means that the variables move in opposite directions. A perfect negative correlation, with a coefficient of -1, means that an increase in one variable corresponds to a proportional decrease in the other. For instance, the amount of time spent driving in traffic might be negatively correlated with overall daily productivity. Just like with positive correlations, perfect negative correlations are unusual in practice, but strong negative correlations can be highly informative about the dynamics between variables.\n\nBoth positive and negative correlation values provide insights into the variables being studied, helping to understand whether and how variables influence each other.\n:::\n\n::: {#7f467a76 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\nmot_temp = mot.copy()\n\n# Drop columns that are not to be included in the correlation matrix\ncolumns_to_exclude = ['vehicle_id', 'test_type', 'age', 'age_years', 'make_model', 'test_result_class', 'test_result_desc', 'fuel_type_desc']\nmot_temp = mot_temp.drop(columns=columns_to_exclude, errors='ignore')\n\n# Encode non-numeric attributes\nlabel_encoders = {}\nfor column in mot_temp.columns:\n    if mot_temp[column].dtype == object:  # Column has non-numeric data\n        le = LabelEncoder()\n        mot_temp[column] = le.fit_transform(mot_temp[column].astype(str))  # Convert and encode\n        label_encoders[column] = le  # Store the encoder if needed later\n\n# Compute the correlation matrix\ncorrelation_matrix = mot_temp.corr()\n\n# Plot the correlation matrix\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix,\n            annot=True,\n            cmap='summer_r',\n            fmt='.2f',\n            linewidths=2).set_title(\"Correlation Heatmap Excluding Specific Columns\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that except for some obvious correlations (for example, `test_mileage` vs `first_use_date`), most of the correlations are reasonably weak. This means that the variables in the dataset do not have strong linear relationships with one another. When correlations are weak, it suggests that changes in one variable are not consistently associated with changes in another in a way that could be described using a simple linear equation. For analytical purposes, this can have several implications:\n\n**Complex Relationships**: The weak correlations imply that if relationships do exist between the variables, they may be complex and not easily modeled by linear regression. Non-linear models or advanced statistical techniques such as decision trees or random forests might be more appropriate to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\n**Multivariate Analysis**: In cases where correlations are weak, it might be useful to look at multivariate relationships, considering the impact of multiple variables at once rather than pairs of variables. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or multiple regression could reveal combined effects of variables that are not apparent when looking at pairwise correlations alone.\n\n**Data Transformation**: Sometimes, transforming the data can reveal underlying patterns that are not visible in the original scale or format. For example, applying a logarithmic or square root transformation to skewed data might expose stronger correlations that were not initially apparent.\n\n**Exploring Causality**: Weak correlations also suggest caution when inferring causality. Correlation does not imply causation, and in the absence of strong correlations, even speculative causal relationships should be considered with greater skepticism. It may be necessary to use controlled experiments or causal inference models to explore if and how variables influence each other.\n\n**Revisiting Data Collection**: Finally, weak correlations may indicate that important variables are missing from the analysis, and additional data collection might be needed. It might also suggest revisiting the data collection methodology to ensure that all relevant variables are accurately captured and that the data quality is sufficient to detect the underlying relationships.\n\n## Exploratory analysis\n\nLet's try and gather some insights from the data.

This is a very simple way to visualise geographic data, and it is quite effective for a quick analysis. We can see that most of the data is concentrated in the south of the UK, which is expected as this is the most populated area.\n\nLooking at the scatter plots, we can derive a few insights based on the geographical distribution of vehicle data across the UK:\n\n**Average Mileage**: The distribution suggests that vehicles in the northern regions generally have higher mileage, indicated by the larger, more intense colored circles in the north compared to the south. This might suggest longer commutes or more frequent use of vehicles in these areas.\n\n**Average Age**: There's a clear gradient of vehicle age from north to south. The northern parts display younger vehicle ages (smaller, lighter colored circles), while the southern regions have older vehicles (larger, darker colored circles). This might indicate economic variations or preferences for newer vehicles in the north.\n\n**Pass Ratio**: The pass ratio varies significantly across different regions. The southeast appears to have higher pass ratios (darker circles), which may correlate with better vehicle maintenance or newer cars in these areas. Conversely, some northern areas show lower pass ratios (lighter circles), possibly due to the older vehicle age or higher usage affecting vehicle conditions.\n\nThese observations hint at regional differences in vehicle usage, maintenance, and age which could be driven by socioeconomic factors, infrastructure, or regional policies. This geographic visualization effectively highlights how vehicle conditions and usage can vary within a country, prompting further investigation into the causes behind these patterns.\n\nLet us now try a similar plot, but focusing on the top/bottom postcode areas for each metric, to highlight the extremes.\n\n::: {#606c6a04 .cell execution_count=22}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Define the figure and axes\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(8, 4))  # Three plots in one row\nfig.suptitle('Highlighting Top and Bottom 7 Postcode Areas by Metric')\n\n# Set up individual color maps and normalization\nnorms = {\n    'Average Mileage': mcolors.Normalize(vmin=postcode_data['Average Mileage'].min(), vmax=postcode_data['Average Mileage'].max()),\n    'Average Age': mcolors.Normalize(vmin=postcode_data['Average Age'].min(), vmax=postcode_data['Average Age'].max()),\n    'Pass Ratio': mcolors.Normalize(vmin=postcode_data['Pass Ratio'].min(), vmax=postcode_data['Pass Ratio'].max()),\n}\n\n# Normalize vehicle counts for bubble sizes\nvehicle_count_scaled = postcode_data['Vehicle Count'] / postcode_data['Vehicle Count'].max() * 1000  \n\n# Determine top and bottom 7 postcodes for each metric\ntop_bottom_7 = {\n    'Average Mileage': postcode_data['Average Mileage'].nlargest(7).index.union(postcode_data['Average Mileage'].nsmallest(7).index),\n    'Average Age': postcode_data['Average Age'].nlargest(7).index.union(postcode_data['Average Age'].nsmallest(7).index),\n    'Pass Ratio': postcode_data['Pass Ratio'].nlargest(7).index.union(postcode_data['Pass Ratio'].nsmallest(7).index)\n}\n\nmetrics = ['Average Mileage', 'Average Age', 'Pass Ratio']\ntitles = ['Average Mileage', 'Average Age', 'Pass Ratio']\nfor i, ax in enumerate(axs):\n    # All postcodes with lower alpha\n    ax.scatter(postcode_data['Longitude'], postcode_data['Latitude'], \n               s=vehicle_count_scaled, \n               c=postcode_data[metrics[i]], \n               alpha=0.2, cmap='Spectral_r', \n               norm=norms[metrics[i]], edgecolor='k')\n    \n    # Highlight top and bottom 7 postcodes with higher alpha\n    highlight_data = postcode_data.loc[top_bottom_7[metrics[i]]]\n    ax.scatter(highlight_data['Longitude'], highlight_data['Latitude'],\n               s=vehicle_count_scaled.loc[top_bottom_7[metrics[i]]], \n               c=highlight_data[metrics[i]], \n               alpha=0.8, cmap='Spectral_r', \n               norm=norms[metrics[i]], edgecolor='k')\n    \n    # Annotate top and bottom 7 postcodes, ensuring coordinates are finite\n    for postcode in top_bottom_7[metrics[i]]:\n        x = postcode_data.loc[postcode, 'Longitude']\n        y = postcode_data.loc[postcode, 'Latitude']\n        if np.isfinite(x) and np.isfinite(y):\n            ax.text(x, y, postcode, fontsize=8, ha='right', color='black')\n    \n    ax.set_title(titles[i])\n    ax.set_xlabel('Longitude')\n    ax.set_ylabel('Latitude')\n    # Create a colorbar for each subplot\n    fig.colorbar(plt.cm.ScalarMappable(norm=norms[metrics[i]], cmap='Spectral_r'), ax=ax, orientation='vertical')\n\n# Adjust layout to prevent overlap\nplt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0, 1, 0.95])  # Adjust the rect to leave space for the main title\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-22-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Developing a classification model\n\nLet us now develop a classification model to predict the likely test result of a car based on some of its features. You might have noticed above that there is a wide disparity in the number of tests for different makes and models, as well as the test results. To ensure we have a true representation of the original distribution, we will perform stratified sampling to ensure we have a balanced dataset.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## About Stratified Sampling\n\nStratified sampling is a statistical method used to ensure that specific subgroups within a dataset are adequately represented when taking a sample. This approach involves dividing the entire population into different subgroups known as strata, which are based on shared characteristics. Once the population is divided, a sample is drawn from each stratum. \n\nThe main reason for using stratified sampling is to capture the population heterogeneity in the sample. For example, if you were conducting a survey on a population consisting of both males and females and you know that their responses might vary significantly based on gender, stratified sampling allows you to ensure that both genders are properly represented in the sample according to their proportion in the full population. This method enhances the accuracy of the results since each subgroup is proportionally represented, and it also increases the overall efficiency of the sampling process because it can require fewer resources to achieve more precise results.\n\nStratified sampling is especially valuable when analysts need to ensure that smaller but important subgroups within the population are not overlooked. By ensuring that these subgroups are adequately sampled, researchers can draw more accurate and generalizable conclusions from their data analysis. This makes stratified sampling a preferred method in fields where precision in population representation is crucial, such as in medical research, market research, and social science studies.\n:::\n\nWe will sample on the `test_result_desc` column, as this is the target variable we are trying to predict.\n\n::: {#db6326b9 .cell execution_count=23}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.utils import resample\n\ndef stratified_sample(data, column, fraction):\n    # Use train_test_split to perform the stratified sampling\n    _, sampled = train_test_split(\n        data, \n        test_size=fraction, \n        stratify=data[column],  # Stratify by the column to keep the distribution\n        random_state=42  # For reproducibility\n    )\n\n    # Drop any categories with less than 100 samples\n    sampled = sampled.groupby(column).filter(lambda x: len(x) > 100)\n    \n    return sampled\n\ndef balanced_sample(data, column, fraction):\n    total_samples = int(len(data) * fraction)\n    num_classes = data[column].nunique()\n    target_size_per_class = int(total_samples / num_classes)\n\n    # Find the maximum size of any class\n    max_class_size = data[column].value_counts().max()\n\n    resampled_data = pd.DataFrame()\n    for class_index, group in data.groupby(column):\n        # Sample without replacement if group size is larger than the target, otherwise keep the group as is\n        if len(group) >= target_size_per_class:\n            resampled_group = resample(group,\n                                       replace=False,  # Sample without replacement\n                                       n_samples=target_size_per_class,\n                                       random_state=42)\n        else:\n            # If the group size is less than the target, and also smaller than the maximum class size, do not resample\n            resampled_group = group  # keep the original group unchanged\n\n        resampled_data = pd.concat([resampled_data, resampled_group], axis=0)\n\n    return resampled_data.reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Our target for prediction\ntarget = 'test_result_class'\n\n# Use only a fraction of the data for faster processing and less memory usage\nmot_encoded = stratified_sample(mot, target, 0.999)\n\n# Show the distribution of the test_result column\nprint(mot_encoded[target].value_counts())\nprint(mot_encoded.shape)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ntest_result_class\nPass     7874347\nFail     2748469\nOther      68257\nName: count, dtype: int64\n(10691073, 19)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we will do a number of things:\n\n1. Since we have a number of categorical variables, and will be evaluating a `LightGBM` classification model, we will need to encode these variables.\n2. We will split the data into training and testing sets, but based on a fraction of the original set (to fit on the memory constraints of my environment).\n3. To ensure a balanced dataset, we will use class weights in the model parameters - in this case, we will use the `balanced` class weight strategy.\n4. We will finally train the model and evaluate its performance, using `GridSearchCV` to find the best hyperparameters.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## About LightGBM\n\nLightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework by Microsoft. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages: faster training speed and higher efficiency, lower memory usage, better accuracy, support of parallel and GPU learning, and capable of handling large-scale data.\n\nThe core algorithm of LightGBM is based on decision tree algorithms and uses gradient boosting. Trees are built leaf-wise as opposed to level-wise as commonly seen in other boosting frameworks like XGBoost. This means that LightGBM will choose the leaf with max delta loss to grow during tree growth. It can reduce more loss than a level-wise algorithm, which is one of the main reasons for its efficiency.\n\nCore Concepts and Techniques\n\n**Gradient Boosting**: Like other boosting methods, LightGBM converts weak learners into a strong learner in an iterative fashion. It constructs new trees that model the errors or residuals of the prior trees added together as a new prediction.\n\n**Histogram-based Algorithms**: LightGBM uses histogram-based algorithms for speed and memory efficiency. It buckets continuous feature (attribute) values into discrete bins which speeds up the training process and reduces memory usage significantly.\n\n**Leaf-wise Tree Growth**: Unlike other boosting frameworks that grow trees level-wise, LightGBM grows trees leaf-wise. It chooses the leaf that minimizes the loss, allowing for lower-loss models and thus leading to better accuracy.\n\nMathematically, the objective function that LightGBM minimizes can be described as follows:\n\n$$\nL(\\Theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^N l(y_i, \\hat{y}_i) + \\sum_{k=1}^K \\Omega(f_k)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{N}$ is the number of data points, $\\mathbf{y_i}$ is the actual label, $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted label, $\\mathbf{l}$ is the loss function, $\\mathbf{K}$ is the number of trees, $\\mathbf{f_k}$ is the model from tree $\\mathbf{k}$, and $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ is the regularization term.\n\n**Loss Function**: The loss function $l(y, \\hat{y})$ depends on the specific task (e.g., mean squared error for regression, logistic loss for binary classification).\n\n**Regularization**: LightGBM also includes regularization terms $\\Omega(f)$, which help to prevent overfitting. These terms can include L1 and L2 regularization on the weights of the leaves.\n\n**Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)**: This is an optimization to reduce the number of features in a dataset with many sparse features. EFB bundles mutually exclusive features (i.e., features that rarely take non-zero values simultaneously) into a single feature, thus reducing the feature dimension without hurting model accuracy.\n\n**GOSS (Gradient-based One-Side Sampling)** and **DART (Dropouts meet Multiple Additive Regression Trees)** are other techniques LightGBM uses to manage data samples and boost performance effectively.\n\nLightGBM is highly customizable with a lot of hyper-parameters such as `num_leaves`, `min_data_in_leaf`, and `max_depth`, which control the complexity of the model. Hyper-parameter tuning plays a crucial role in harnessing the full potential of LightGBM.\n:::\n\nLet us now encode all categorical features in the dataset (`LightGBM` cannot handle unencoded categories), and split the data into training and testing sets.\n\n::: {#e1e20836 .cell execution_count=24}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Encode the categorical columns\nle = LabelEncoder()\ncategorical_features = ['make', 'model', 'fuel_type', 'postcode_area', 'test_result_class']\nfor col in categorical_features:\n    mot_encoded[col] = le.fit_transform(mot_encoded[col])\n\nfeatures = ['test_mileage', 'test_class_id', 'cylinder_capacity', 'age_years', 'make', 'model', 'fuel_type', 'postcode_area']\nX = mot_encoded[features]\ny = mot_encoded[target]\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe are now ready to train the models.

Hyperparameters are the configuration settings used to tune the learning algorithm, and they can significantly impact the performance of the model. Using `GridSearchCV` allows you to search through a grid of hyperparameters and find the best combination that maximizes the model's performance, as measured by a specified evaluation metric. However, it is important to note that hyperparameter tuning can be computationally expensive, especially when searching through a large grid of hyperparameters. Therefore, it is essential to balance the trade-off between computational resources and model performance when tuning hyperparameters, as well as understanding model performance to target the most impactfull hyperparameters.\n:::\n\n::: {#1d271ecb .cell execution_count=27}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ny_pred = best_model['model'].predict(X_test)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's print the classification report for the model, as well as the confusion matrix.\n\n::: {#47d20041 .cell execution_count=28}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\n# Display the classification report and accuracy score, decode the labels\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=le.classes_, zero_division=1))\nprint(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')\n\n# Calculate the confusion matrix\nconf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, normalize='pred')\n\n# Plot the confusion matrix\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='.2g', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=le.classes_, yticklabels=le.classes_)\nplt.title('Confusion Matrix')\nplt.xlabel('Predicted')\nplt.ylabel('Actual')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n        Fail       0.37      0.68      0.48    551359\n       Other       0.70      0.89      0.78     13670\n        Pass       0.84      0.59      0.70   1573186\n\n    accuracy                           0.62   2138215\n   macro avg       0.64      0.72      0.65   2138215\nweighted avg       0.72      0.62      0.64   2138215\n\nAccuracy: 0.6193039521282939\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-28-output-2.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analysis of training results\n\nHere's an interpretation of the metrics for each of the target classes, followed by overall model performance:\n\n- **Fail**:\n  - **Precision**: 37% of instances predicted as \"Fail\" were actually \"Fail.\"\n  - **Recall**: The model correctly identified 68% of all actual \"Fail\" instances.\n  - **F1-Score**: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, standing at 48%, indicates moderate effectiveness for this class, somewhat hindered by relatively low precision.\n  - **Support**: There are 551,359 actual instances of \"Fail\" in the test data.\n\n- **Other**:\n  - **Precision**: 70% of instances predicted as \"Other\" were correct.\n  - **Recall**: The model successfully identified 89% of all actual \"Other\" instances.\n  - **F1-Score**: At 78%, this score shows relatively strong performance in predicting the \"Other\" class, supported by both high precision and recall.\n  - **Support**: There are 13,670 actual instances of \"Other\" in the test data.\n\n- **Pass**:\n  - **Precision**: 84% of instances predicted as \"Pass\" were correct.\n  - **Recall**: The model correctly identified 59% of all actual \"Pass\" instances.\n  - **F1-Score**: The score is 70%, indicating good prediction power, although this is lowered by the recall being significantly less than the precision.\n  - **Support**: There are 1,573,186 actual instances of \"Pass\" in the test data.\n\n- **Overall Model Performance**:\n  - **Accuracy**: Overall, the model correctly predicted the class of 62% of the total cases in the dataset.\n  - **Macro Average Precision**: On average, the model has a precision of 64% across classes, which does not take class imbalance into account.\n  - **Macro Average Recall**: On average, the model has a recall of 72% across classes, indicating better sensitivity than precision.\n  - **Macro Average F1-Score**: The average F1-score across classes is 65%, reflecting a balance between precision and recall without considering class imbalance.\n  - **Weighted Average Precision**: Adjusted for class frequency, the precision is 72%, indicating a good predictive performance where it matters the most in terms of sample size.\n  - **Weighted Average Recall**: Matches the overall accuracy.\n  - **Weighted Average F1-Score**: Stands at 64%, factoring in the actual distribution of classes, showing overall model effectiveness is moderate, skewed somewhat by performance on the most populous class.\n\nThis report shows that while the model performs quite well in identifying \"Other\" and reasonably well on \"Pass,\" it struggles with precision for \"Fail.\" The recall is high for \"Fail,\" suggesting the model is sensitive but not precise, potentially leading to many false positives. The high macro averages relative to the accuracy indicate performance variability across classes.\n\n## Final remarks\n\nIn this experiment, we have analysed the MOT test results of cars in the UK, focusing on the top most tested cars in the dataset. We have performed some exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of test results, vehicle age, and mileage, and have developed a classification model to predict the likely test result of a car based on its features.\n\nThe model we developed is a `LightGBM` classifier, trained on a balanced dataset using stratified sampling. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 62%, with varying performance across different classes. While the model performed well in identifying the \"Other\" class and reasonably well on \"Pass,\" it struggled with precision for \"Fail.\" This suggests that the model may be overly sensitive in predicting \"Fail,\" leading to many false positives.\n\nIn future work, it would be interesting to explore additional features that may influence the test results. It would also be beneficial to investigate the impact of socio-economic factors, such as the area where the vehicle is registered, on the test results. Additionally, further tuning of the model hyperparameters and feature engineering could potentially improve the model's performance.\n\n",
